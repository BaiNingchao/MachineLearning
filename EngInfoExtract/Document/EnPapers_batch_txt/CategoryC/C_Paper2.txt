Calciothermic Reduction of Titanium Oxide and in-situ
Electrolysis in Molten CaCl2
RYOSUKE O. SUZUKI, KOH TERANUMA, and KATSUTOSHI ONO 
A concept for calciothermic direct reduction of titanium dioxide in molten CaCl2 is proposed and
experimentally tested. This production process consists of a single cell, where both the thermochemi-
cal reaction of the calciothermic reduction and the electrochemical reaction for recovery of the reduc-
ing agent, Ca, coexist in the same molten CaCl2 bath. A few molar percentages of Ca dissolve in the
melt, which gives the media a strong reducing power. Using a carbon anode and a Ti basket-type cath-
ode in which anatase-type TiO2 powder was ﬁlled, a metallic titanium sponge containing 2000 ppm
oxygen was produced after 10.8 ks at 1173 K in the CaCl2 bath. The optimum concentration of CaO
in the molten CaCl2 was 0.5 to 1 mol pct, to shorten the operating time and to achieve a lower oxygen
content in Ti.
I.
INTRODUCTION 
THE Kroll process produces metallic titanium industri-
ally. It consists of a three-step operation: the conversion from
TiO2 to TiCl4, the subsequent reduction of TiCl4 to sponge Ti
by liquid Mg, and the electrochemical recycling of MgCl2
into metallic Mg.[1] It takes 2 to 5 days in this reduction route
via TiCl4, and the batch operation makes it difﬁcult to save
thermal energy. A simpler, more rapid, and compact process
in a single step directly from TiO2 has been desired to
achieve higher productivity and energy savings.[2–8]
Recently, we proposed brieﬂy the possible routes to go
from TiO2 directly to metallic Ti, using calcium as a reduc-
tant and CaCl2 as the supporting media.[4–8] The purpose of
this article is to report our concept in detail and to show
some experimental veriﬁcation. 
II. CONCEPT
A. Thermodynamic Requirements 
[1] 
The possible elements that are candidates as reductants (R)
of TiO2 should meet several requirements. First, the oxides
of the reductants (RO) should be thermodynamically more
stable than the lowest oxide of titanium, TiO.
TiO + R = Ti + RO
where R is selected judging from the standard free-energy
change of Reaction [1] (G
[1]) from a thermodynamic
database.[9]
Second, a reductant with a wide solubility in Ti or with a
strong compound formability with Ti is not suitable. For ex-
ample, α -Ti dissolves 44.8 mol pct Al, and the residual
amount of reductant Al forms a Ti-Al alloy. Carbon is one of
the common reductants, but is not applicable because of TiC
formation. Table I lists elements which can reduce TiO,
whose solubility in Ti does not exceed 5 mol pct[10] and
which do not make any compounds with Ti.

The third criterion is the deoxidation capacity. For exam-
ple, Mg equilibrates thermodynamically with Ti containing
about 2 to 3 mass pct oxygen,[11,12] and a subsequent deoxi-
dation procedure is needed after reduction with Mg. In addi-
tion, the acid leaching of MgO was too slow for practical
mass production.[13] Rare-earth elements are not suitable as
reductants if they cannot be recycled inside the operating
system. Radioactive or noxious elements are excluded as
TiO2 reductants.
Ca was selected as being applicable both for direct reduc-
tion of TiO2 and for deoxidation of Ti. The residual oxygen in
Ti has been measured as 300 to 730 mass ppm, when Ca and
CaO coexisted in equilibrium at 1173 to 1373 K.[11,12,14–18]
This oxygen level is suitable for industrial purposes. The
solubility of Ca in β -Ti is also as low as 50 to 200 ppm
at 1155 to 1600 K.[19]
Alexander ﬁrst patented the reduction of TiO2 using Ca in
1936.[20] However, ductile titanium could not be produced,[13]
because a few thousand parts per million oxygen remained in
the formed Ti.[12,14–16] The slow mass transfer through the
byproduct CaO, attached to the surface of Ti particles,
hindered further deoxidation.[12,14–16] The formed Ti particles
easily sintered tightly, because reaction [1] is exothermic.[9]
CaO was easily captured in the Ti grain boundaries during
sintering and was barely removed by acid leaching.[12,14 –16]
B. Calciothermic Reduction in Molten CaCl2
Calcium chloride (CaCl2) is an abundant and inexpensive
salt which melts at 1048 K and is thermodynamically stable
with Ca. CaO solubility in molten CaCl2 is about 20 mol pct
CaO at 1173 K.[21–24] When we applied the calciothermic
reduction in the molten CaCl2, the byproduct CaO was
removed in situ from the reaction place and dissolved into
the salt, which enhanced the reduction,[2–8] as illustrated in
Figure 1.
TiO2 + 2 Ca = Ti + 2 CaO
where CaO represents the dissolved CaO in the salt. Note
that the solidiﬁed CaCl2 is more easily separated from Ti
powder with water than is CaO with acid leaching. CaCl2
could supply Ca toward the oxides homogeneously,[25] and
the molten salt released the exothermic heat from the reac-
tion.[25,26] The simultaneous usage of Ca and CaCl2 in oxide

reduction was reported only at the production of Pu,[26] Nd,
an Fe-Nd alloy,[27,28,29] or Nb-Ti alloys.[25]
The densities of liquid Ca and CaCl2 at 1173 K are 1.357 ×
103 and 2.01×103 kg/m3, respectively,[30] which separates
into two layers. As illustrated in Figure 1, TiO2 does not come
TiO2 and β-Ti at 1173 K are evaluated as 4.40 × 103 and
into contact with Ca, because the densities of rutile-type
4.15 × 103 kg/m3, respectively.[30,31] Ca dissolved in molten
CaCl2 (the solubility of Ca is 2 to 4 mol pct[32–38]) could
reduce TiO2 powder experimentally.[4–8]
TiO2 + 2 Ca = Ti + 2 CaO
where Ca represents dissolved calcium. Pure Ca is not nec-
essary to reduce TiO2 into the metallic Ti, and Ca formed
electrochemically can be used for TiO2 reduction, as shown
in this work. 
[3]
C. Electrolysis of CaO in Molten CaCl2
In order both to enhance CaO dissolution and to recycle
the byproduct CaO, the dissolved CaO is removed from the
salt and decomposed to metallic Ca, using the electrochemi-
cal reaction in the molten salt.[3,8,39–41] CaO is decomposed
into ions as 
CaO = Ca2+ + O2−
The electrochemical potential necessary for CaO decom-
position is evaluated in Figure 2 from a thermochemical
database.[9] Because the theoretical decomposition voltage of
CaO into O2 gas and Ca (2.71 V at 1173 K) is lower than that
[4]
, C+ O2−

of CaCl2 (3.213 V), Ca can be produced by the molten-salt
electrolysis of CaO. This oxygen-gas evolution, however, re-
quires an oxidation-resistive material such as a nonconsum-
able anode material. The decomposition voltage of CaO is
close to that of CaCl2, and the overpotential makes it difﬁcult
to exclude Cl2 gas evolution. Instead of using a nonconsum-
able anode for O2 gas evolution, a consumable carbon anode
can lower the potential by 1.03 V.[4–6,8,39–41]
At the anode: C + 2 O2− = CO2 (gas) + 4e
= CO (gas) + 2e
At the cathode: Ca2+ + 2e
Even in case of a low activity of CaO (aCaO), the decomposi-
tion voltage of CaO remains much lower than that of CaCl2
decomposition, as shown in Figure 2.
Many previous attempts of CaCl2 or CaO electrolysis
were reported.[22,24,28,39–44] However, it was not easy to de-
posit either pure liquid Ca or a liquid Ca alloy with a good
yield and a good current efﬁciency, because the precipitated
Ca dissolved immediately back into the salt and parasitic re-
actions occurred. During electrolysis at temperatures above
the melting point of Ca, the formation of a so-called “metal
fog” of Ca has been often observed in the vicinity of the
cathode.[22,43,44] This metal fog holds the reducing potential
to cause the parasitic reactions. Some earlier reports sug-

ions as Ca dis-
solved in the salt “Ca,” to express the reducing ability or po-
tential near the cathode, no matter which is the so-called
metal fog after deposition—the ionic state such as Ca2
or,
simply, dissolved metallic calcium. This reducing atmos-
phere of Ca is thermochemically equivalent to Ca in Eq. [2]
and served here for the reduction of TiO2 instead of the par-
asitic Reactions [8] and [9]. We will put TiO2 powder at the
vicinity of the cathode (Figure 3) to consume Ca in
the molten salt, as written in Eq. [3].

D. Combination of Reduction and Electrolysis 
The electrolysis and reduction can be combined together,
as illustrated in Figure 4. The conceptual image of the two
reaction vessels (Figure 4) was proposed in calciothermic re-
duction of TiO2, Nd2O3, and radioactive elements.[2,3,39–42]
Ca or Ca formed at the cathode is passed with a part of the
molten salt toward the reduction vessel and is used for the
reduction of the oxide powder. The byproduct, CaO, and
the solvent CaCl2 are returned to the upper vessel. However,
no experimental proof has been reported, probably because
of the difﬁculties of depositing pure Ca by electrolysis. TiO2
powder could be successfully reduced by Ca as well as by
pure Ca.[7] It was not directly proven whether Ca produced
by electrolysis could be used for the reduction.
The single-unit operation (Figure 3) is ideal; it omits the
connection paths between two vessels, and the Ca is served
instantly for TiO2 reduction. The reduction is operated in the
Fig. 4—Illustration of separate model.
temperature range of 1120 to 1350 K, considering the melt-
ing point and evaporation of Ca. The electrolysis is also con-
ducted in the similar temperature range. Because the calcio-
thermic reduction and the electrolysis are exothermic and
endothermic, respectively, thermal energy can be saved by
setting two reactions in a close spatial arrangement such as
in Figure 3.[4,5,6]
E. Deoxidation by Ca
Metallic Ca can effectively extract the residual oxygen in
Ti into CaCl2.[47–51]
[O]Ti + Ca = Ca2+ + O2−
[10]
where [O]Ti is oxygen in the Ti particles (maximum of
14 mass pct). When we could reduce TiO2 to Ti powder in
Eq. [3], the obtained Ti powder would be simultaneously de-
oxidized by Eq. [10]. This deoxidation proceeds effectively
when the CaO concentration is low. Our previous report
showed that the oxygen content in Ti powder just reduced
from TiO2 decreased to <1000 ppm in 1 hour and to 420 ppm
in 1 day.[7,8] However, the amount of CaO in the melt after
the reduction would be much larger than that suitable for de-
oxidation. When the CaO concentration becomes higher
than 5 mol pct, the dissolution rate of Ca and CaO becomes
slower.[24,34,38]
The electrolysis of CaO can decrease the CaO concentra-
tion in the melt, and the oxygen content in Ti cathode wires
of [O]Ti > 1000 ppm O was reported to be decreased to a
<30 ppm O level.[52,53] Although the oxygen diffusion be-
came the rate-determining step in the case of the thick wires,
we can expect the more-efﬁcient deoxidation in the case of

the ﬁne Ti powder just precipitated from TiO2. In the single-
cell operation (Figure 3), the reduced Ti particles can be also
deoxidized by the electrochemical mechanism.[52,53]
F. Overall Reaction 
Our proposed process starting from TiO2 is summarized
from all the working reactions ([2] through [6] and [10]) that
TiO2 is reduced by carbon as 
TiO2 + C = Ti + CO2 and TiO2 + 2C = Ti + 2CO [11]
This overall reaction is the same as that in the Kroll process,
where the reductant Mg and the byproducts, TiCl4 and
MgCl2, are circulated in a close system.[1]
III. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Figure 5 shows the experimental arrangement for the si-
multaneous reactions, i.e., reduction and in-situ electrolysis.
A graphite crucible (99.9 pct in metallic purity, 55 mm o.d.,
40 mm i.d., and 150 mm in depth) was used as the anode. It
was connected to a stainless steel rod (4 mm in diameter)
and a lead to a direct-current power supply. About 300 g of a
mixture of anhydrate CaCl2 (>99 pct) and CaO (99 pct, cal-
cined at 1473 K in air) was ﬁlled in the crucible and heated
in vacuum at 623 to 773 K overnight. It was then melted in a
puriﬁed Ar gas atmosphere and held for 3.6 ks with frequent
stirring. The preelectrolysis with a stainless steel or Ti cath-
ode rod at 1.0 to 1.3 V was conducted at 1173 K to eliminate
metallic impurities and water.
A pure Ti net (No. 100 mesh) or a SUS304 stainless steel net
(No. 250 mesh) was used for the cathode material. It was dou-
bly wound like cylinder (6 to 8 mm i.d. and about 150 mm in
length) and tightened by thin Ti wires. The bottom was sealed
by a Ti block. About 0.5 to 3 g granular TiO2 (>99 pct, anatase,
Fig. 5—Experimental setup for TiO2 reduction.
primary particle size <1 µm) was ﬁlled in this basket-type
cathode. The size of the aggregates was about 200 to 800 µm,
so that 91.9 pct of them were larger than the No. 100 mesh. The
basket-type cathode was connected to a stainless steel pipe
(6 or 8 mm o.d.) and a lead to the power supply.
After pre-electrolysis, the basket-type cathode was im-
mersed in the salt (about 30 to 50 mm in depth) and held at
30 mm above the bottom at 1173 ± 5 K in Ar gas. A direct
current was supplied under a constant voltage. The applied
voltage between the two electrodes was measured just out-
side the vessel. Ar gas was blown to the melt surface through
the pipe for the cathodic lead. The evolving gas was trapped
in an aqueous solution containing Ca(OH)2 or AgNO3 to de-
tect CO2 or Cl2 gas, respectively. 
After electrolysis, the cathode was taken out of the melt
and cooled in Ar gas at the upper part of the furnace. The so-
lidiﬁed salt in the basket-type cathode was leached in the
ﬂow of drinking water, with cooling below 283 K.[7] The
black Ti powder was subsequently rinsed with dilute HCl (or
acetic acid), distilled water, and alcohol, in that order, and
then dried in vacuum for analysis. The obtained powder
was identiﬁed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement.
The oxygen concentration was analyzed by an inert gas
fusion–infrared absorption method. The morphology was ob-
served using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped
with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Electrolysis and Reduction above 3.3 V
During electrolysis above 3.3 V at 1173 K (the decompo-
sition voltage of CaCl2 is 3.213 V[9]), a faint amount of CO2
gas evolution was detected in addition to a large amount of
Cl2 gas, as listed in Table II. The O2 and CO gases were not
analyzed.
Figure 6 shows the current change during electrolysis. In
the early stage (<2 ks), the current dropped rapidly to half of
the initial value and then increased gradually. Because of the
drop of the bath resistance, the voltage between the elec-
trodes increased slightly during electrolysis, as listed in
Table II. The current density was 0.4 to 0.8 × 104 A /m2 for
the cathode net area. A small amount of hydrogen gas bub-
bles were released at all the parts of solidiﬁed salt when the
salt dissolved in water. It may prove the precipitation of Ca
during cooling. The bulk Ca was never found in the basket-
type cathode. It is believed that calcium formed by electrol-
ysis dissolved as Ca into the salt. 
The sample obtained in the Ti cathode was black and
slightly sintered, when it contained α-Ti phase. Figure 7
shows SEM images of the obtained powders, which con-
sisted of α-Ti single phase. The formation of twin structures
due to the high oxygen concentration was observed on the
particle surface. A lower Ti oxide, TiO0.325, was also de-
tected by XRD in the case of short-term electrolysis, al-
though this suboxide is not stable at the operating tempera-
ture.[10] We judged that the stable phase at 1173 K (α-Ti)
transformed to TiO0.325 during cooling, because the oxygen
solubility in α-Ti is about 31.9 mol pct. 
The analyzed oxygen concentration was relatively high,
even when the samples were α-Ti single phase (runs c-1 and
c-2). Considering that the reduction by a sufﬁcient amount of
Ca could produce α-Ti with 1000 mass ppm O in only 3.6 ks

at the same temperature,[7] the reduction rate of TiO2 in this
experimental cell, i.e., the effective forming rate of Ca, was
not so fast as the Ca reduction rate. When we deﬁne the cur-
rent efﬁciency as the ratio of (the necessary charge to attain
the analyzed oxygen level)/(the applied charge during elec-
trolysis), it is evaluated to be 8.8 and 25.5 pct for the samples
for 10.6 and for 3.6 ks, respectively (Table II). Parts of the
applied charge were consumed for the ohmic heat in the elec-
tric leads and bath and for the formation of inefﬁcient Ca.
The excess Ca was recombined with Cl2 gas,

or reacted with carbon oxides. The details of the parasitic re-
actions and current efﬁciency are discussed in Section IV–D. 
[12] 
B. Electrolysis and Reduction Below 3.0 V
During electrolysis below 3.0 V (lower than the decompo-
sition voltage of CaCl2) and above 2.0 V, only CO2 gas evo-
lution was observed, as listed in Table II. Figure 8 shows the
current change during electrolysis at 1173 K. The current
generally dropped at the beginning of electrolysis, then in-
creased gradually. The higher the concentration of CaO that
was used, the larger the current was, under the same experi-
mental geometry and the same applied voltage (refer to the
“total charge” in Table II). A larger amount of Ca was ex-
pected to reduce TiO2 more effectively. However, α-Ti sin-
gle phases could be obtained after 10.8 ks, only with the salts
with a lower concentration of CaO. When 15 mol pct CaO
was used, lower oxides such as TiO0.325 or Ti6O were mixed
with α-Ti even after 10.8 ks. 
Figure 9 shows the morphology of α-Ti single phases.
Grain sizes were similar to the case of CaCl2 electrolysis (Fig-
ure 7). A twin structure was never observed in sample f-1,
which achieved the minimum oxygen concentration, 2000
ppm O. In the case of short-term electrolysis, lower Ti oxides
existed independently from α-Ti particles. A part of the ob-
tained powder was α-Ti single phase (Figure 10(a)), but an-
other part in the same specimen was TiO0.325 single phase
(Figure 10(b)). The former was characterized by its coarser

grains than the latter and by the sintered form. When the pow-
der was identiﬁed as TiO0.325 or Ti6O, all the particles were
well isolated and smaller in size. The inhomogeneous reduc-
tion in the same sample reﬂects the inhomogeneous distribu-
tion of Ca and CaO contents inside the basket-type cathode.
Axler and DePoorter[38] reported that Ca solubility in
CaCl2 decreased with the addition of CaO, and that the Ca
supply into the CaCl2-CaO melt became slow at >5 mol pct
CaO. The slow dissolution of Ca and CaO leads to a higher
oxygen concentration in Ti and the local inhomogeneity of
oxygen, when the CaO content in the salt is higher.
In the case of pure CaCl2, TiO2 was reduced to the lower
oxide, TiO0.325, but α-Ti was not obtained after 10.8 ks of
electrolysis. This is because the charge was limited in the
electrolysis under a constant voltage. Once a small amount
of CaO by the reduction of TiO2 was served in the CaCl2
melt, Ca would be produced by Eqs. [4] through [7], and it
could reduce TiO2 subsequently. However, the total supplied
charge was much smaller than that in the system containing
CaO initially.
A quick reduction by Ca produces a region of high CaO con-
centration, while it hinders the successive dissolution of CaO
from the reduced Ti particles and results in the inhomogeneous
Fig. 10—SEM images of sample e-2, which was obtained in 1 mol pct

deoxidation. A lesser amount of CaO does not form enough
Ca for reduction. Therefore, it is essential for this process in a
single bath to keep a good rate balance among three steps; the
thermochemical reduction of TiO2, the dissolution of CaO,
and the electrochemical decomposition of CaO.
C. Electrolysis using Stainless Steel 
Table III shows the results when a stainless steel basket-
type cathode was used as an alternative to the Ti net. The
current behaviors were similar to those shown in Figure 8.
The obtained black powders were commonly identiﬁed as a
mixture of α-Ti, TiC, and a small amount of α-Fe. TiO, TiN,
or TiC were identiﬁed by XRD, because they have the same
crystal structure and similar lattice parameters. Because
EDX analysis could not ﬁnd any trace of oxygen or nitrogen,
TiC formation was accepted. The origin of carbon is dis-
cussed in Section IV–D.
The EDX analysis showed that some α-Ti particles were
heavily contaminated by Fe and Ni. This is due to physical
contact between the formed Ti and the surrounding stainless
steel net. It was conﬁrmed by the fact that some pieces of
pure Ti wire were also contaminated when they were im-
mersed in the stainless steel basket for 10.8 ks. Particles of
α-Fe were sometimes found. They might come from the cor-
rosion product formed before immersing the steel net, by the
fume of CaCl2, or from residual amounts of HCl.
D. Carbon Precipitation 
The problem encountered mainly in CaO electrolysis was
carbon precipitation. Carbon dust was observed in the upper
part of the bath and froze as a crust layer about 5 mm thick, in
the worst case. The black layer consisted mainly of amor-
phous carbon and the salt components. Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3
were often found by XRD. They might be formed with the re-
action with CaO, moisture, and CO2 gas in air before the XRD
measurement. CaC2 was never found by XRD. The amount of
carbon precipitates during CaO electrolysis was much more
than that of CaCl2 electrolysis and was related to neither elec-
trolysis time nor total charge. The cell arrangement, such as
the distance between electrodes, affected more strongly the
carbon precipitation. The gradual increase of current in Fig-
ures 6 and 8 may reﬂect this reaction related with carbon.

The carbon precipitates penetrated into the basket-type
cathode and contaminated the Ti powder. The surface of
the Ti basket reacted partially with carbon, not with the
stainless steel basket. This TiC formation from the Ti basket
protected the Ti powder inside the cathode from carbon
contamination. 
Carbon can be formed by the mechanism shown in
Eqs. [8] and [9], mentioned in Section II–C. Another mech-
anism is the following: 
Near the anode: O2− + CO2 (gas) = CO3
[13]
In the bath: 3 Ca + CO3
2− = C + 3Ca2+ + 3O2− + 2e
[14]

The amount of carbon precipitation by Eq. [14] may be more
signiﬁcant at a high CaO concentration or at a high forming
rate of CaO in reduction, because the solubility of CO2 gas
becomes higher.[54] Because the dependency of C precipita-
tion on CaO content was not clear in this study, the latter
mechanism was still uncertain. However, the occurrence of
these parasitic reactions consumes a large amount of Ca, and
it signiﬁcantly decreases the current efﬁciency. 
Ferro et al. proposed the use of a porous MgO diaphragm
in order to separate CO/CO2 gas from Ca.[39,40,41] By analyz-
ing the cell behavior and gas bubbling, we believe that the
cell design is a key to solving the matter. In Figure 3, the
cathode itself plays a kind of wall to separate the anodic re-
gion and cathodic region. The ﬂow of the gas bubbles along
the anode should be controlled more precisely to avoid the
parasitic reactions.[4,5,6] Another solution is the control of
CaO concentration, as given in section IV–E.
E. Comparison between Electrolysis above and below 3.2 V
CaCl2 electrolysis requires about a two-times-higher volt-
age (E) than CaO electrolysis, and the total charge for Cl2
evolution was larger than that for CO/CO2 evolution, as
listed in Table II. The reduction was completed within 3.6 ks
in CaCl2 electrolysis. However, the oxygen concentration in
Ti and the current efﬁciency were better in the case of CaO
electrolysis. In our experimental conditions, the amount of
O2−
coming from TiO2 was not so large: the increment of
CaO concentration was evaluated to be only 1.0 to 1.5 mol
pct CaO, even if we assume that the formed CaO was not
electrolyzed. This small increase, therefore, does not change
the deoxidation rate from α-Ti.
The low current efﬁciency shows that a large amount of
Ca was consumed for the back-reaction [12] (>3.2 V) and
for reactions [8], [9], and [14] (<3.2 V). The higher quantity
of CaO can produce the larger amount of Ca; however, the
excess of Ca is consumed by these back- and parasitic reac-
tions. At a lower concentration of CaO, a lesser amount of
Ca is formed per unit time. It reacts more effectively with
TiO2 powder located near the cathode. A low CaO concen-
tration is suitable for deoxidation, as shown in Eq. [10], and
decreases the possible formation of CO3
.

F. Comparison with Previous Works 
[16] 
[15]
Some other trials were reported to produce Ti electro-
chemically from TiO2 in CaCl2. Because TiO2 is insoluble in
the molten salt, the dissolution of TiO or CaTiO3 into CaCl2
was used.[55,56] Oki and Inoue connected a cathode wire di-
rectly to TiO2 in CaCl2 and reported the formation of Ti.[57]
Recently, Chen et al. explained it as a simple mechanism of
a direct electrolysis of cathodic TiO2.[58,59,60]
At the cathode: TiO2 + 2e = Ti + O2−
At the anode: 2O2− = O2 (gas) + 2e
where the role of anions was not considered. The compari-
son between this FFC (Fray-Farthing-Chen) process and our
proposal is illustrated in Figure 11. Although its operating
mechanisms are different, the bath, carbon anode, and ap-
plied voltage are apparently similar. The FFC process uses
the sintered pellets of TiO2 as the cathode, and the oxygen
diffusion in cathodic Ti plate is required. 
We believe that Ca ions play a certain role in reactions,
ﬁrst, because CaTiO3 was sometimes formed. Second, at the
applied voltage in the FFC process, Ca from CaO can pre-
cipitate on the surface of the TiO2−x cathode. If the evolved
oxygen gas in Eq. [13] reacts with the anodic carbon to form
CO/CO2 gas, the total reactions in the FFC process and our
proposal become the same reaction, shown in Eq. [11].
Our process does not need a direct electrical contact be-
tween TiO2 and the cathodic lead, and TiO2 can be fed in
powder form, which is suitable for oxygen removal because
there is no requirement of oxygen diffusion in a long dis-
tance. A short-term reduction and deoxidation can be possi-
ble using our principle. 
G. Veriﬁcation of Calciothermic Reduction 
A preliminary experiment showed that Ca worked in our
cell: TiO2 was ﬁlled in a small Y2O3 crucible and placed in-
side the Ti basket-type cathode. Because Y2O3 is an elec-
tronic insulator and thermodynamically more stable than
CaO, the TiO2 powder was electronically isolated from the
cathodic lead. After holding for 10.8 ks at 1173 K, the pow-
der at the upper part of the Y2O3 crucible changed to α-Ti,
TiO, Ti2O3, and CaTiO3, although TiO2 at the bottom of
the crucible remained unchanged. This fact could not be
explained by the FFC mechanism. Simultaneously, the inho-
mogeneity in this Y2O3 crucible proved that a uniform

dispersion of TiO2 powder in CaCl2 or the exposure of TiO2
to CaCl2 is a technical key to obtain good homogeneity.
V. CONCLUSIONS 
A concept was proposed that Ti granular sponge could be
produced directly from TiO2 powder, by combining both the
calciothermic reduction and the in-situ electrolysis of CaO
in the CaO-CaCl2 bath, as shown in Figure 3. Theoretical
and technical requirements for this concept were described
in detail, and the potential to obtain a Ti powder suitable for
an industrial oxygen level was analyzed, based on the previ-
ous studies.
Experimentally, the concept was tested using the basket-
type cathode, in which TiO2 was ﬁlled. The reduction of
TiO2 per unit time was superior in the electrolysis of Cl2 gas
evolution (E > 3.2 V at 1173 K), while the residual oxygen
level in Ti was better in the electrolysis of CO/CO2 gas evo-
lution (E < 3.2 V). A level of 2000 ppm oxygen in α-Ti was
achieved within 10.8 ks using the 0.5 to 1 mol pct CaO-
CaCl2 melt. 
Parasitic reactions such as carbon precipitation and the
back-reaction lowered the current efﬁciency to 8 to 25 pct.
These reactions will be minimized by the modiﬁcation of
cell design and by a good rate balance among three steps: the
calciothermic reduction of TiO2, the dissolution of CaO, and
the electrochemical decomposition of CaO.
