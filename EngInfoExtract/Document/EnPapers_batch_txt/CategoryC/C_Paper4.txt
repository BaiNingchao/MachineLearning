A process to produce titanium powder from Ti2⫹ in the molten salt was confirmed experimentally.
It consists of two steps. In the first step, titanium (IV) chloride gas dissolves in the molten salt as
the titanium (II) chloride by reacting chemically with the metallic titanium or magnesium. In the
second step, this molten salt is exposed to the metallic reductant Mg for the final reduction to the
metallic Ti powder. Experimentally, the feed of TiCl4 gas and the subsequent reaction with Ti prepared
the molten salt containing 5 to 10 mass pct Ti2⫹. By Mg reduction of this salt, the well-isolated
fine Ti particles were recovered. The powder morphology and particle size depended on the Ti2⫹
concentration, reduction temperature, time, and concentration of the by-product MgCl2. The stirring
by argon gas bubbling effectively grew the fine and round particles to a few tens of microns in size.
I.
INTRODUCTION
SOME new production processes such as hydride-
dehydride (HDH), gas atomizing, and plasma rotating elec-
trode process (PREP) are applied for the preparation of
titanium powder suitable to powder metallurgy.[1] However,
these processes do not satisfy the reasonable price, funda-
mentally because they need the precast Ti ingot or compact
as the starting material. To exclude the extra cost for ingot
making, a specialized powder produced directly from its
chloride looks promising.[2]
TiCl4 is an indispensable intermediate compound for tita-
nium metal production, and it has been used as common
base material in the established titanium industries. In a
modification of the conventional Hunter process (sodium
reduction of TiCl4), a method has been industrially applied,
where TiCl4 was dissolved as TiCl2 in the molten salt (main
constitution is NaCl) after the weak sodium reduction.[3,4]
When subsequent reduction by sodium is applied to the
molten salt, the slightly sintered titanium called “sponge
fine” powder is produced after the mechanical crashing.
This powder is commercially supplied to powder metallurgy.
When sodium is used as the reductant, however, there are
some technical and economical problems in the handling of
metallic sodium, NaCl removal, and sodium recycling by
electrolysis of NaCl.[3] In the magnesium reduction (Kroll
process), the electrolysis of its by-product, MgCl2, has been
developed more efficiently and becomes economical by the
improved operating techniques and modernized facilities.
Considering the industrial backgrounds surrounding the
Kroll process, we expect that the electrolysis of MgCl2 will

be available, when we can reduce Ti2⫹ in the molten salt
using not Na but Mg.
In the Kroll process, TiCl4 is fed to the top surface of the
molten Mg, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). However, it could
not produce the Ti powder. Its product was heavily sintered
as “sponge” titanium.
Recently, the authors proposed an alternative titanium
production process, as shown in Figure 1(b), where the Mg
melt floated on the heavier molten MgCl2.[2] When the gas-
eous TiCl4 was fed from the bottom of the molten Mg,
metallic Ti powder could be successfully produced from
TiCl4 in the Mg layer. The particles settled through the
molten MgCl2 did not sinter as firmly as the Kroll sponge
and were easily pulverized.[2] The obtained powder was well
isolated and about 1 to 10 ␮m in size. Because the solubilities
of TiCl4 in the chloride salts are only a few mass pct, as
listed in Table I, a large amount of the supplied TiCl4 could
not dissolve in the salt, and should be reduced in the molten
Mg layer.
Table I shows that the solubilities of Ti3⫹ and Ti2⫹ are
generally larger than that of Ti4⫹. Using the lower chlorides
such as TiCl3 and TiCl2, we can expect the higher total
concentration of Ti ions in the salt.
The purpose of this article is to develop the method spe-
cialized for the isolated particle production of Ti using Mg,
Ti2⫹, and the molten salt as the solvent. Here, some basic
experimental evidence in laboratory scale is shown under
this concept to consider the technical aspects for indus-
trial application.
II. CONCEPT OF TWO-STEP PRODUCTION
Our concept for Ti powder preparation using magnesium
as the reductant is illustrated in Figure 1(c). It consists of
the two steps.
In the first step, TiCl4 is fed and dissolved into the molten
salt. Both TiCl4 molecules and Ti4⫹ react with Mg, where
a half amount of Mg required for the complete reduction of
Ti4⫹ to Ti is consumed for Ti2⫹ formation as follows.
TiCl4 ⫹ Mg ⫽ TiCl2 ⫹ MgCl2
[1]

instead of the industrial reactions [1] and [2]. The Ti2⫹ is
in a more stable oxidation state than Ti3⫹ when they coexist
with metallic Ti in the molten chlorides.[16,17,18]
Figure 2 shows the conceptual view of Ti production using
Eq. [3]. By feeding TiCl4 gas into the prepared molten salt
containing Ti powder, the titanium (IV) chloride dissolves
as the lower oxidation state of Ti such as Ti2⫹. Thus, obtained
molten salt will be served for the next step.
The subsequent Mg reduction shown in Eq. [4] causes
the nucleation in the salt:
TiCl2 (in salt) ⫹ Mg (liquid)
⫽ Ti ⫹ MgCl2 (in salt)
Because of density difference, the reductant Mg floats on
the molten salt, as shown in Figure 1(c), and the precipitated
Ti will settle on the bottom of the reaction vessel. In Figure
2, the Ti product will be extracted and the molten salt con-
taining Ti can be partially returned as the salt for Reaction
[3]. The other half of the Ti product will be separated from
the molten salt as the final product. The distillation and
electrolysis of MgCl2 will be used for the close circulation
of Mg when the process is industrially applied.
This work experimentally studies the feasibility of the
second step in the laboratory bench to find the applicability
of magnesiothermic reduction to the lower chlorides and to
clarify the morphology of Ti precipitates. In spite of the
concept of continuous production by connecting two steps
(Figure 2), the individual steps are studied here in the sepa-
rated experiments.

III. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
A. Preparation of Molten Salt
The molten salts dissolving Ti2⫹ were prepared using the
experimental apparatus shown in Figure 3. Dehydrated LiCl
(99.0 pct in purity), KCl (99.5 pct), NaCl (99.5 pct), and
dehydrated MgCl2 (98.8 pct, ⬍3.0 pct water) were mixed
in 150 to 200 g. About 8 g “sponge titanium” (99.5 pct)
was set with the mixed chlorides in the Al2O3 (95.3 pct)
crucible (40-mm i.d. and 150-mm high). The crucible was
mounted in the reaction vessel, evacuated at 473 K for 7.2
ks to dry the molten salt, and heated to 1173 K in Ar gas
flow. After melting the salt, 99 pct MgO lance (6 mm in

into molten Mg (Kroll process), (b) TiCl4 gas feed to bottom of Mg layer
through the molten salt,[2] and (c) combined process with TiCl4 gas feed
for Ti2⫹ formation and metallic Ti formation from its molten salt (this study).
The formed TiCl2 and MgCl2 cannot completely mix in a
homogenous liquid written as MgCl2-50 mol pct TiCl2, because
the solubility of TiCl2 in MgCl2 is 35 mol pct at 1173 K.[6]
In the Hunter method, the formed TiCl2 produces the salt
mixture of NaCl-33 mol pct TiCl2 by the following reaction:
TiCl4 ⫹ 2Na ⫽ a salt (TiCl2 ⫹ 2NaCl)
[2]
because the solubility of TiCl2 in NaCl is 44 mol pct at 1123
K and 52 mol pct at 1173 K.[10]
In our case, the additional amount of molten salt is needed
as the solvent of Ti2⫹. This means that TiCl4 is fed into the
mixture consisting of the molten salt and the reductant Mg.
This salt needs some requirements: a thermodynamic stabil-
ity against both Mg and Ti, a large solubility of Mg and Ti
ions, and a fast dissolution of TiCl4.[2] The alkaline and
alkaline-earth chlorides are studied here.
Because of the difference of specific gravity between Mg
and the molten salt, the lighter Mg floats above the heavier
salt.[2] When TiCl4 is fed to the upper surface of the molten
Mg layer, the spatial arrangement for the reduction becomes
similar to the Kroll process (Figure 1(a)), and we cannot
expect the continuos and homogenous reaction in Eq. [1].
Therefore TiCl4 will be fed from the bottom of the molten
Mg layer as in the arrangement shown in Figure 1(b).
The best method suitable to dissolve TiCl2 into the molten
salt is still not fixed when Mg is used. As another method,
we can take the reaction as

i.d.) was immersed to contact titanium sponge and 25 or 50
g of TiCl4 liquid (⬎99 pct) was fed at the constant rate of
3.3 mg/s from the TiCl4 container by the tube pomp. After
the feed at 1173 K, the reactor was once cooled in the
furnace under Ar gas atmosphere. The solidified salt was
taken off from the crucible and its bottom part was mechani-
cally separated, because the residual Ti sponge was mixed.
A part of the solidified salt was dissolved in the dilute
hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, and the titanium concen-
tration in the salt was analyzed using the inductively coupled
plasma– atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP–AES).
B. Mg Reduction of Molten Salt
The molten salt thus produced was filled in the Al2O3
(⬎99.5 pct) crucible (34-mm i.d. and 150-mm high). In the
same procedure as the salt preparation, the salt mixture
was again melted under Ar gas flow using the experimental

the molten salt.
apparatus shown in Figure 4. In some experiments, the salts
were diluted to be 1.43 mass pct Ti with the pure salt con-
taining no titanium.
About 20 g Mg (99.9 pct) blocks were quietly charged
using the Ti rod and melted on the molten salt. The Ar gas
was bubbled in the salt at the rate of 8.3 ⫻ 10⫺6 m3/s through
the MgO lance when stirring was needed. After cooling
in the furnace, the crucible was crashed into pieces for
macroscopic observation, and the solidified salt was leached
by water and the dilute acetic acid solution. The powder
that piled up on the crucible bottom and that which adhered
to the crucible wall were separately recovered. The magne-
sium and salt residual in these powders were completely
removed using ultrasonic cleaning equipment with the dilute
hydrochloric acid solution. The powder was rinsed in water,
alcohol, and acetone, in that order.
After drying, the powder was weighed and observed using
a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an
energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. The phases were
identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement. The
impurity aluminum in the reduced powder was analyzed by
ICP –AES, and the oxygen and nitrogen concentrations were
analyzed by the inert gas fusion-infrared absorption method.
IV. RESULTS
A. Molten Salt Containing Ti2⫹
The vibration of MgO lance indicated that the supplied
liquid TiCl4 was evaporated inside the lance (the boiling
point of TiCl4 is 409 K) and that its bubbles were fed into
the molten salt. A fairly large amount of TiCl4 gas was
exhausted out of the vessel during the feed, although its
quantity could not be measured because of strong reaction
with the materials for exhaust circuit.
After solidification, the salts were usually dark green, as
listed in Table II. A deep red salt was obtained when the
feeding lance did not arrive at the Ti sponge. Because the
TiCl3 crystal is reddish violet,[16] such charge was excluded.
After the experiments, a large amount of Ti sponge was

consumed. The residual Ti sponge was brittle and easily
broken into small pieces. Its fine particles dispersed in the
salt. Considering the wider reaction interface between the
gaseous TiCl4 and the solid Ti, the fine powder as Ti source
seems better to ensure a good reactivity. However, this exper-
imental result implies that the bulky Ti can be applied as
the starting material.
The analyzed titanium concentrations, CTi, are listed in
Table II. No systematic relation between the color of the
salt and the titanium concentration was found. The CTi
exceeded the equilibrium solubility of TiCl4 at 1173 K,
compared with the reported data listed in Table I.
Because the valancy analysis of titanium in the salt using
H2 gas evolution[18] did not show the reproducible values,
the yields were deduced using the analytical values. Assum-
ing that the dissolved TiCl4 could be perfectly converted
into TiCl2, the amount of Ti2⫹ supplied from TiCl4 in the
salt, WTi, is equal to the amount of Ti2⫹ supplied from sponge
Ti, and it can be calculated in Eq. [5].

where Msalt, MTi, and MCl are the mass of the initial salt and

where MTiCl4 is the molecular weight of TiCl4. Similarly, the
yield RTiCl3 was defined.
Although a large amount of TiCl4 gas was exhausted out,
the calculated yield RTiCl3 exceeded unity. Therefore, the
chemical species dissolved in the salt was judged to be
mostly at the oxidation state II, namely, Ti2⫹. The exact ratio
Ti3⫹/Ti2⫹ under the coexistence with TiCl4 and Ti should
be determined in the further study, for example, from the
electrochemical analysis.[19] Based on the previous stud-
ies,[17,18,19] we assume that Ti(II) is the main oxidation state
when the metallic Ti coexists with its chlorides.[17,18]
The highest yield RTiCl2 was recorded in the LiCl-KCl
eutectic salt and the lowest in the MgCl2 single salt. The yield
might be improved by the technical methods, for example, by
securing the wider reaction area with TiCl4 bubbles. For this
work, the amount of charged Ti was limited so that CTi did
not approach the saturation value, in order that the contami-
nation of metallic Ti pulverized at the first step should be
avoided for the morphology observation at the successive
stage.
B. Mg Reduction of Molten Salt
After the Mg reduction of molten salts containing Ti2⫹,
a fine metallic powder was recovered and identified as ␣-
Ti single phase by XRD. All salts after solidification were
white. This indicates that there remained no Ti ions in the
salt. The fine Ti particles dispersed in the salt disturbed the
chemical analysis of Ti ions in the solidified salt.
Although the quantities of Ti powder were only 5 to 20
g, the yields were calculated to be roughly 85 to 90 pct,
based on the amount of the used salt and CTi. Note that they
contained an underestimation because of imperfect powder
recovery from the crucible.
Table III summarizes the experimental conditions and the
powder morphology. No difference was found between the
powder at the bottom of the alumina crucible and that at
the crucible wall, although some morphological change was
reported when an Fe crucible was used.[2,20 – 22]
1. Effects of stirring and reduction temperature
Using LiCl-KCl eutectic salt containing 5.7 mass pct Ti,
the effects of stirring and reduction temperature on morphol-
ogy were shown in Figure 5. When Ar gas was not bubbled,
the narrow rods were obtained at 1173 K for 21.6 ks in
addition to the granular Ti. At 973 K, only the thin rods
were found, and the round grains were rare. In removing
the salt, some flakes floated in the acid solution. Their mor-
phology was dendritic but their volume fraction was very
small.
When Ar gas was bubbled, neither rods nor dendrites
were found, and only the round particles with smooth surface
were recovered. The diameter of these particles was larger
at 1173 K. At 973 K, the finer particles of 1 to 5 ␮m
were aggregated.
2. Effect of titanium concentration
Figures 5(c) and 6 show the powder morphology precipi-
tated from the salts at 1173 K with stirring. The round
particles were commonly found in the molten salts with
different Ti concentrations. The particles precipitated from
the salt containing 1.43 mass pct Ti were smaller than the
others.
Even when the titanium content in the salt was diluted,

stirring, as shown in Figures 5(c) and 7. Under these condi-
tions, the rodlike powder was not formed. The white color
of the solidified salt indicated that, surprisingly, the Mg
reduction had been over for 0.3 ks after Mg melting. Note
that it took a relatively longer time to cool in the furnace.
The round particles were finer than 1 ␮m when they formed
for 0.3 ks. In the prolonged holding time, they were aggre-
gated and sintered to the larger single particles of 10 to 30

4. Effect of salts
Another four molten salts were studied, as listed in Table
III, and the morphology of Ti particles is shown in Figure
8. Powder morphology obtained in the NaCl-KCl eutectic
salt (Figure 8(c)) was similar to that in LiCl-KCl (Figure
5(c)), although Ti2⫹ in the Li-containing salt was more stable
than that in NaCl-KCl.[9] Those in the salts containing MgCl2
were mixtures of two types: one was the large round particle
of tens of microns with a smooth surface similar to that in

the effect of stirring on powder shape was similar. The
narrow rods were found when there was no stirring.
3. Effect of time
Using the salt containing 5.7 mass pct Ti, the effect of
holding time on morphology was studied at 1173 K with
METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B
VOLUME 30B, JUNE 1999— 407
powder contained 1 to 4 mass pct oxygen, 0.3 to 0.8 mass
pct nitrogen, and 0.2 to 6 mass pct aluminum. The higher
aluminum and oxygen contents were recorded in the powder
when it was treated at higher temperatures or when the
amounts of produced titanium were smaller. The nitrogen
concentration did not depend on the reaction conditions.
Therefore, the sources must be the atmospheric nitrogen and
impurity nitrogen in Mg.
In the same charge of the reduction, the same Al concen-
trations were analyzed by EDX over all the particles with
different morphologies. The impurity source of Al is there-
fore judged to be the Al2O3 crucible, because the strong
reductant Mg can reduce alumina thermodynamically.
Water in the salt and the atmospheric oxygen may be the
oxygen sources in addition to Al2O3. This oxygen can react
with Mg to form MgO. MgO was also used as the lance.
Under the coexistence of Mg (reductant) and MgO, the
oxygen concentration in Ti can rise thermodynamically to
2.0 to 3.0 mass pct at 1173 K.[23,24] The analytical values
of oxygen may reflect such a thermodynamic saturation
value. For the commercial application as pure Ti, oxygen
should be kept at a thousand mass parts per million level.
The effect of hydrogen and oxygen may be suppressed, by
using the metallic vessel, by reducing water contamination
in the initial MgCl2 or by improving the handling of the
continual operation.
If we can suppress the undesired dendritic precipitation
at the iron wall,[2,20 – 22] the steel is applicable for the reactor ’s
material, because iron does not contaminate titanium as
heavily as Al2O3, as confirmed in the industrial Kroll
process.
V. DISCUSSION
When the molten salts based on alkaline and alkali-earth
chlorides are used, the reductant Mg floats on them. The
Mg solubilities in these molten salts are as small as 0.3 mol
pct, whereas the Na solubility in NaCl is about 3 mol
pct.[25,26] In addition to the small solubility, it is reported
that the dissolution of Mg into the salt was slow.[27]
When TiCl4 gas fed in the molten LiCl-KCl or NaCl-KCl
eutectic salt was reduced in one step by Mg, the isolated
particles larger than 10 ␮m were often the angular polyhedra
with good crystalline form.[27] Its morphology suggested that
titanium could nucleate homogeneously in the molten salt.
However, such morphology was never observed in this study.
Because Ti3⫹ becomes more stable at low temperatures,[19]
the oxidation state of titanium may affect nucleation. How-
ever, once the metallic Ti is formed, the disproportionation
reaction to form Ti2⫹ occurs[18] and Ti2⫹ becomes the main
oxidation state.
Therefore, we assume here that Ti2⫹ in the salt would
react inhomogeneously only near the interface between mol-
ten Mg and the molten salt. The product Ti is assumed to
precipitate gradually as a nodule, as illustrated in Figure 9,
although the local precipitation mechanism is not clear in
atomic scale. Under these assumptions, the experimental
observation of powder morphology will be explained as
follows.
When the quiet interface can be kept as illustrated in
Figure 9(a), the Ti nodules, rods, or dendrites grow from
the bottom part of the molten Mg layer, depending on the

LiCl-KCl, and the other was the finer round particle of 1 to
5 ␮m in diameter.
Because MgCl2 is the main by-product in Mg reduction,
even if the initial salt does not contain MgCl2, it will soon
be contaminated in the process of reduction. In this work,
the final increase of MgCl2 concentration was less than 20
mass pct MgCl2 even in the salt with the highest Ti2⫹
concentration.
C. Impurity Contamination
Impurity concentrations in the recovered Ti powder were
analyzed by ICP –AES and they are listed in Table III. The

Mg distribution in the salt near the interface. These morphol-
ogies are dominant especially at the lower temperatures at
which Mg diffusion into the salt is slow.
When Ar gas is injected (Figure 9(b)), the strong stirring
disperses mechanically the Mg droplets into the salt. Two
liquid phases mix like the emulsion. The reduction rate is
enhanced because the interface between Mg and the salt
increases and because the dissolving rate of Mg is acceler-
ated. The unsteady interface by Ar gas bubbling disturbs
a continuous growth of the nodules. Thus, nucleated fine
particles frequently collide by themselves, aggregate, and
sinter to the coarser particles. The union of particles in the
stirred salt generates the coarsening for the long holding
time. It is supported by the fact that the morphology of the
recovered large particles was round but uneven.
The settling rate of the precipitate Ti particle in the molten
salt depends mainly on the particle size. The terminal veloc-
ity in the quiet salt at 1173 K is evaluated as 2.78, 0.111 mm/
s, and 1.11 ␮m/s for 50, 10, and 1 ␮m particles, respectively,
applying the Stokes law to Ti particles in MgCl2.[28,29] The
realistic settling rate of Ti particles is much slower, consider-
ing a heavy stirring by gas bubbling. The particles do not
settle until they grow up to a certain size in the salt.
Due to the inevitable use of the molten salt, the number
density of the precipitated Ti particles is low, particularly
in the molten salt of the low Ti2⫹ concentration. The collision
rate becomes lower, and the aggregation of particles is sup-
pressed even in the stirred salt. In the Ti2⫹ rich molten
salt, the Ti particles have precipitated at the initial stage of
reduction (for example, for 0.3 ks at 1173 K), and they may
absorb the fine particles that were formed at the final stage.
It was reported in the Kroll process that the residual mag-
nesium physically attaches to the precipitated Ti particles
and that the attached Mg layer enhances the coarsening and
agglomeration to Ti sponge.[30,31] The characteristic mor-
phology in the Kroll process, i.e., the aggregated and strongly
sintered Ti particles of a few tens of microns, however,
was hardly observed in this work. It is suggested that the
generated Ti particles sank in our molten salt without the
further contact with Mg. This may be one of the reasons
why the obtained particles were well isolated.
For use in powder metallurgy, fine powder with a weak
size distribution is required. The suitable size is dependent
on the final product and is usually said to be several tens
of microns. The existence of the fine particles smaller than
10 ␮m might be uncomfortable for this purpose. Therefore,
the result in the salt containing 41.2 mass pct MgCl2 shows
that the concentration control for the solvent salt is indispens-
able to produce the larger particles in a homogeneous quality.
Considering that the industrial MgCl2 salt in the Kroll
process contains a high content of LiCl, KCl, NaCl, etc. for
better efficiency in electrolysis, we may find the nice molten
salt suitable both for the large Ti powder production and for
the good MgCl2 electrolysis.
The fact that the reduction from Ti2⫹ in the salt was
completed in a short time shows that the growth mechanism
is a key to obtaining powder suitable for powder metallurgy.
A further approach will be needed to grow the fine powder
to adjust to the demand of powder metallurgy.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
A process was proposed to produce titanium powder in
two steps using TiCl4 and magnesium. In the first step, TiCl4
dissolves once in the molten salt as Ti2⫹, where either a half
amount of the reductant Mg or a part of the final product

Ti is used to convert TICl4 into Ti2⫹. In the second step,
Mg reduction of Ti2⫹ in the molten salt precipitates the fine
Ti powder.
The powder morphology was experimentally studied
under this concept. The reduction finished within 0.3 ks
at 1173 K, and the successive holding in the salt grew
the particles. The powder size depended on the initial
Ti2⫹ concentration, temperature, holding time, and concen-
tration of by-product MgCl2. Stirring of the molten salt
was enhanced to produce the round and well-isolated
particles of a few tens of microns, which is suitable for
powder metallurgy.
This process can produce the t itan ium powder in the
shorter steps compared w ith the other methods , such as
HDH and PREP. The indus tr ia l app lica tion of th is pro-
posal seems techn ical ly poss ib le , when the addi tional
method to separate Ti powder from the mo lten sa lt is
developed .
