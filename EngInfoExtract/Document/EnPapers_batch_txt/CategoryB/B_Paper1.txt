Abstract 
Production of titanium powder directly from titanium dioxide (TiO2) through an electronically 
mediated reaction (EMR) using calcium as a reductant was investigated. Feed material (TiO2 
powder or preform) and reductant (Ca-Ni alloy) were charged in electronically isolated 
locations in a molten calcium chloride (CaCl2) salt at 1173 K. The current flow through an 
external circuit between the feed and reductant locations was monitored during the reduction of 
TiO2. The electrochemical potential of the feed electrode was intermittently measured during 
the reduction experiment to analyze the reduction process. After the reduction experiment, pure 
titanium powder with low nickel content was obtained even though liquid Ca-Ni alloy was used 
as a reductant. These results demonstrate that titanium powder can be produced without direct 
physical contact between the feed and reductant. In certain experimental conditions, pure 
titanium powder with a purity of 99.5 mass% was successfully obtained.

Introduction 
A new efficient reduction process that can serve as an alternative to the Kroll process [1] is 
being investigated by many researchers. Although various types of titanium reduction 
processes have been studied in the past, none of them could be used for industrial purposes. The 
key factors in developing a commercial process, which can compete with the Kroll process, are 
the establishment of technology for effective purity control and/or speeding up of the reduction 
process. 
Fray et al. have recently been trying to develop a new industrial reduction process, called the 
FFC process, based on the direct electrochemical reduction of TiO2 to metallic titanium in a 
molten CaCl2 salt [2]. The principle of the FFC process is schematically shown in Fig. 1 (a). 
The sintered TiO2 feed electrode (cathode) is immersed in a molten CaCl2 salt, and polarized 
cathodically to remove oxygen from the feed electrode. Metallic titanium is directly obtained 
by electrochemical technique. The main chemical reactions are expressed as equations in Fig. 2 
(a1) and (a2). It is interesting to note that, according to Eq. (a1), the reduction of titanium 
oxides proceeds without the precipitation of metallic calcium. The features of the FFC process 
and other processes are listed in Table 1. This technique is simple and its advantage is that it 
makes the process semi-continuous. The product titanium, produced by electrolysis, using 
molten CaCl2 salt as a medium, is deoxided down to 10 mass ppm oxygen levels after reduction 
of titanium oxides. The FFC process, however, has some disadvantages: impurities, such as 
carbon and iron, tend to accumulate in the titanium deposits because the feed electrode is

largely electronegative. Since it is difficult to achieve high current efficiency, the energy 
efficiency of the FFC process will also be a key factor affecting its commercial use. The 
extensive work conducted by Fray et al. has not only inspired academic research activities on 
titanium but has also stimulated related industries. As a result, a large variety of titanium 
reduction processes are currently under investigation [3-5]. For example, Ono and Suzuki are 
engaged in developing a commercial process, based on the calciothermic reduction of TiO2 
powder in a molten CaCl2 salt [3]. The principle of their process, called the OS process, is 
schematically shown in Fig. 1 (b). The main chemical equations are shown in Eq. 2 (b1)-(b3).  
In the OS process, reductant calcium is produced by electrolysis, and titanium powder is 
obtained by metallothermic reduction using the calcium produced electrochemically. Along 
with the FFC process, it also has some advantages: the process is simple and can be 
semi-continuous, but it is also sensitive to carbon and iron contamination. Separation of excess 
calcium from the titanium powder product may also be a key technique for increasing energy 
efficiency. The excess calcium on the titanium deposit may affect leaching efficiency.

In this study, we have carried out fundamental research on a new titanium reduction process 
with the aim of developing a new technology for preventing the accumulation of impurities in 
titanium deposits through an electronically mediated reaction (EMR) [6, 7]. The conventional 
representation of the calciothermic reaction of TiO2 assumes that the reaction proceeds by the 
transport of reactants through the product phase. Contact between TiO2 and calcium is 
achieved by diffusion of the reactants through the product phase, and therefore the product 
phases are often considered as barriers in metallothermic reactions. According to the concept 
of an EMR, a metallothermic reaction can be readily broken into two electrochemical steps as 
shown in Eq. 2 (c1) and (c2). When an electrically conducting medium exits to facilitate 
electron transfer and when local electroneutrality conditions are satisfied, reactions can, in 
principle, proceed at different locations. The feasibility of reducing an insoluble oxide in CaCl2 
by the EMR was demonstrated by Okabe et al. in 1999, where pure niobium powder was 
obtained by electrochemical reaction directly from Nb2O5 using a calcium alloy as reductant 
[7]. The EMR is effective in maintaining purity control when combined with the conventional 
molten salt electrolysis (MSE) of CaO in a molten CaCl2 salt. It is also suitable for improving 
the energy efficiency in the production of calcium alloy reductant. One of the features of the 
EMR/MSE process is that the reduction of TiO2 takes place without any direct contact with the 
reductant alloy because titanium is reduced by the electrons discharged from the reductant. By 
using the EMR/MSE process, the reduction of TiO2 and the electrical power input for 
producing reductant alloy can be carried out separately. This makes it possible to carry out 
titanium reduction during the day, and electrolysis for producing reductant alloy during the 
night. In this study the possibility of applying this EMR/MSE process for the reduction of TiO2 
was investigated.

2 Experimental 
A schematic diagram of the reduction apparatus is shown in Fig. 3. Anhydrous CaCl2, which

was used as the molten salt medium, was dried in a vacuum at 473 K for over 43 ks before the 
experiment. TiO2 powder (99.9%, average particle size 2 µm) was used as the feed material, and 
in some cases it was made into a preform [8] with the aim of achieving effective salt/metal 
separation. The feed preform was fabricated from the slurry, which was made by mixing TiO2 
powder (5-10 g) and a binder solution (10-15 g). A collodion solution, which is a mixture of 5 
mass% nitrocellulose in ethanol and ether, was used as a binder solution. In some experiments, 
flux such as CaCl2 was added into the slurry. The synthesized slurry was cast into a stainless 
steel mold to make the preform. The fabricated preform was heated at 1073 K before reduction 
in order to remove the binder and water. TiO2 powder or the preform containing TiO2 powder 
(5-10 g) was kept in a sample holder and charged in a molten CaCl2 salt (1300-1500 g) at 1127 
K in an argon atmosphere. TiO2 was electrochemically reduced by the electrons discharged 
from the reductant alloy. The holder containing the TiO2 powder or preform was placed in the 
molten salt to prevent it from making physical contact with the Ca-18 mass% Ni reductant alloy 
(50-80 g). The current flow (iA/C) through an external circuit between TiO2 and the Ca-Ni alloy 
was monitored using a standard resistance of 1 mΩ. In order to monitor the driving force of the 
chemical reaction, the electrochemical potential (∆EA/C) between the feed electrode and the 
reductant alloy was intermittently measured by opening the external circuit during the reduction 
experiment.

After the reduction experiment, the sample holder was taken out of the reactor and soaked in 
distilled water for 24 h to dissolve the CaCl2. The titanium powder obtained after the 
experiment was recovered by leaching it with acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. The metal 
powder obtained was then rinsed with distilled water, alcohol, and acetone, and finally dried in 
a vacuum. The morphology of the metal powder was observed by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). Phases in the sample were identified by an X-ray diffraction analysis 
(XRD). The composition of the sample was determined by energy dispersive X-ray 
spectrometer (EDS), and analyzed by 
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission 
spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The oxygen concentration of the powder deposit was determined by 
inert gas fusion-infrared absorption spectroscopy (LECO).

3 Results and Discussion 
As shown in Fig. 4 (a), an external current (iA/C) of 0.2-0.4 A was observed between the anode 
and the cathode for the first 500 s. Time zero corresponds to the moment when the feed TiO2 
powder in the sample holder (cathode) was charged in the molten CaCl2 salt. In the experiment 
shown in Fig. 4, the reductant Ca-Ni alloy (anode) was also charged in the molten salt at the 
same time. The external current, iA/C, fell below 0.1 A after 3 ks. When the external current fell 
below 0.03 A, the sample holder was taken out of the molten CaCl2 salt and the reduction 
experiment was terminated. In most cases, the reduction was completed within 2 h. The amount 
of the electric charge (Qexp.) that passed through the external path was calculated by means of 
time integration of the observed external current, and it was about 650 C for the case shown in 
Fig. 4 (a). It was found that this value was about 3% of the theoretical electric charge (Qtheo.) 
necessary for reducing 5 g of TiO2, which was used as a feed material. The percentage of the 
obtained charge with respect to the theoretical charge, XEMR (= 100 × Qexp./Qtheo.), varied 1-9% 
depending on the experimental conditions. Figure 4 (b) shows the change in the 
electrochemical potential between the cathode and the anode, which was obtained by opening 
an external circuit periodically. For the initial 2 ks of the reduction experiment, the 
electrochemical potential was more than 0.05 V, and the ∆EA/C decreased with time. The 
theoretical driving force of the reaction, ∆Etheo., calculated from the standard Gibbs energy 
change of the reactions shown in Eq. (c1) and (c2) in Fig. 2 (or Fig. 3 (b)) is 0.62 V at 1173 K 
[9]. The value of the ∆EA/C observed during the reaction experiment was substantially smaller 
than that of the ∆Etheo.. The reason for this is not clear at this stage, but it is possible that the 
dissolution of calcium in the CaCl2 molten salt caused electronic conduction through the 
molten CaCl2 under highly reducing atmosphere.

Figs. 5 (a) and (b) show the SEM image and the XRD pattern of the obtained titanium 
powder, respectively. It was found that after the reduction experiment, pure titanium powder 
was produced in the sample holder. The analytical results of the obtained titanium powder are 
listed in Table 2. These results clearly show that the feed material (TiO2) was reduced without 
any physical contact with the reductant (Ca-Ni alloy). It is worth noting that the nickel content 
in titanium was quite low, at just 0.2 mass%, even though a Ca-18 mass% Ni alloy was used as 
the reductant. The detailed mechanism of TiO2 reduction in molten CaCl2 through an EMR is 
currently under investigation because there are various interpretations for this reduction 
mechanism [2][3]. In the experiments investigated in this study, titanium with a high purity of 
99.5% or more was obtained by using an EMR. In certain experimental conditions, titanium 
powder with 3500 ppm of oxygen was successfully obtained.

To understand the local reaction, a three-dimensional (3-D) chemical potential diagram of the 
Ti-Ca-O system at 1173 K was constructed [9, 10], and is shown in Fig. 6 (a). The diagram 
provides an insight into the phase relationship during the EMR. Point “α” in Fig. 6 (a), 
corresponds to the Ti / Ca / CaO (in molten salt) equilibrium and can be connected to point “β”, 
which corresponds to the Ti / TiO / CaO (in molten salt) equilibrium, through the metal/molten 
salt interface (solid two-phase equilibrium shown by the line between point “α” and “β”). Fig. 6 
(b) is a schematic representation of the EMR pathway which is consistent with the chemical 
potential diagram. The metal/molten salt interface, which corresponds to the line connecting 
points “α” and “β” in Fig. 6 (a), connects the two three-phase fields. In this situation, the 
reductant calcium need not necessarily make physical contact with the titanium oxides; rather 
electron and ion transfer may be the major steps in this reduction process when molten salt 
exists in the system.

4 Conclusions and Future Remarks 
The experimental results for the calciothermic reduction of TiO2 in a molten CaCl2 salt showed 
that the electronically mediated reaction (EMR) can be applied to the direct reduction process 
of titanium oxide. The reduction of TiO2 proceeds without direct physical contact with the 
reductant Ca-Ni alloy, and contamination of titanium can be effectively prevented by utilizing 
an EMR. This approach may be applied to develop a (semi-)continuous process for the 
production of titanium powder. 
When considering industrial electrolysis, the most compromised issue is the energy 
efficiency of the electrolysis, and its efficiency in the direct reduction of titanium oxides is low 
at present. However, the industrial electrolysis process of manufacturing reductants, such as 
calcium or magnesium, is established and it is possible to produce them with a comparatively 
high efficiency. Using the process cell of the EMR/MSE process shown in Fig. 3 (b), it is 
possible to manufacture and stock the reductant by a molten salt electrolysis at night when the

cost of power is low, and the titanium reduction process using labor power can be performed 
during the day. In this study, the reduction of titanium dioxide as a feed material was 
investigated. This reduction technique is also suitable for the reduction of halogenides, in which 
case the application of the EMR/MSE process may extend to recycling of the molten salt or 
efficient separation of the metal/salt.
