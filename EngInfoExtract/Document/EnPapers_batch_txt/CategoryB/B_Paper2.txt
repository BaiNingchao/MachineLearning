this paper based on the electro-deoxidation of a metal oxide
in a molten salt electrolyte which has oxide ion solubility.
The pioneering work in this ﬁeld, the so-called FFC process
[2] describes the electro-deoxidation of titanium dioxide in a
calcium chloride electrolyte at 950 °C. The process involves
the direct electrochemical reduction of a metal oxide in
molten calcium chloride. The oxide cathode is in good
physical contact with a current collector and the metal oxide
is progressively reduced through a series of part reactions
involving intermediate binary oxide phases of the form
aCaO:bMxOy where a, b, x and y are integers and M is a
metal. Oxide ions are released into the bulk salt and dis-
charged on a graphite anode which is consumed to form CO2.
The work in this paper applies the FFC process to the
reduction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) in a sodium hydroxide
electrolyte at the lower temperature of 530 °C to produce a
grade of iron (
Abstract
Iron(III) oxide tablets were electrolytically
reduced to iron in molten sodium hydroxide at 530 °C and
recovered to produce iron with 2 wt.% oxygen suitable for
re-melting. The cell was operated at 1.7 V and an inert
nickel anode was used. The thermodynamics and mecha-
nism of the process was also investigated. By controlling
the activity of sodium oxide in the melt, the cell could be
operated below the decomposition voltage of the electro-
lyte with the net sequence of events being the ionization of
oxygen, its subsequent transport to the anode and discharge
leaving behind iron at the cathode. A reduction time of 1 h
was achieved for a 1 g oxide tablet (close to the theoretical
reduction time predicted by Faraday’s laws) at a current
density of 520 mA cm-2 with iron phase yields of *90
wt.%. The energy consumption was 2.8 kWh kg-1.

1 Introduction
Directives to reduce global emissions in CO2 [1] are now
ﬁrmly in place which puts pressure on heavy industry
sectors such as iron and steel whose products are used in
vast quantities around the world.
There is a European directive to partially replace existing
technology with ‘‘greener’’ routes. A process is proposed in

experiments, they produced a phase of iron that was 5
mol% in oxygen using a nickel ferrite/copper cermet
anode. However,
the latter decomposed severely when
using viable current densities, resulting in anodic dissolu-
tion of copper into the salt and subsequent co-deposition
and contamination of the iron phase. When graphite anodes
were used, the reduction was hampered by carbon particles
blocking the pores of the oxide preventing electrolyte
contact to the oxide.

2 Experimental
2.1 Precursor preparation
Sheathed Thermocouple
Inconel 600 reactor
Ni connecting rod
Iron(III) oxide (Aldrich 99+%) of particle size between 1
and 5 lm was pressed without a binder at 3 ton in an
isostatic press using a 20 mm dye. The un-sintered tablets
were weighed and their volume measured. The tablets were
then sintered at various temperatures in the range 900–
1300 °C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 3 °C/min was used.
After sintering,
the tablets were re-weighed and their
volume re-determined. This enabled the pre-sintered and
sintered densities to be estimated based on a uniform pore
distribution.
2.2 Materials and setup
A nickel (201 alloy—99% Ni with Cu and Fe added to pre-
vent embrittlement at temperatures above 315 °C) basket
with a screw-in nickel connector rod was used to hold the
tablet
throughout an experiment. The crucible (55 mm
id 9 61 mm od 9 160 mm height) was also fabricated from
nickel and contained in an outer alumina crucible. The anode
consisted of a nickel 201 rod of 5 mm diameter.
The crucible was packed with *400 g of sodium
hydroxide (97% assay) pellets (*6 9 4 mm). The salt was
melted and ‘‘topped-up’’ to 600 g. The purpose of the large
pellets was to reduce the surface area, reducing water
absorption during transport to the crucible and furnace. The
entire assembly was held in a sealed reactor made from
Inconel 600
which in turn sat inside a vertical tube fur-
nace. The reactor shown in Fig. 1 was ﬁlled with argon and
a steady ﬂow (50 cm3 min-1) maintained throughout the
experiment.

2.3 Method
Reductions using an iron(III) oxide cathode and nickel
anode were performed. A power supply (Thurlby Thandor
PL154) with feedback sensing was used which enabled the
current to be accurately measured across a counter resistor
and maintain a constant applied voltage. A digital data

Fig. 1 Schematic of high temperature cell
recorder (Agilent 34970A) was used to record voltage,
current and temperature.
The anode was submerged 5 cm into the salt and the
cathode tablet 7 cm. The system was allowed to reach
thermal equilibrium by waiting 15 min prior to applying a
voltage which was slowly swept to the target value to
prevent spiking of the current.
After the reduction, the Ni basket was raised near the top
of the reactor (gas temperature *90 °C) and left to cool in
argon. The powder/tablet and basket were then removed
and immersed in cold de-aerated water to dissolve the
electrolyte and recover the product. In later experiments,
water was replaced with aqueous ethanol (90 vol.% etha-
nol:10 vol.% water) to help prevent partial re-oxidation of
the iron. After several washes,
the pH checked using
phenolphthalein pH indicator paper to detect the presence
of alkali, the rod was removed from the basket and the
tablet or powder dried in argon at room temperature. The
effect of cell voltage and adding 1 wt.% sodium oxide to
the electrolyte were investigated.
The decomposition voltage of the electrolyte containing
1 wt.% Na2O was measured by applying a staircase voltage
to a cell containing an empty nickel basket and observing
the current. Tangents were drawn to the curves represent-
ing current ﬂow before and after salt decomposition and the
point of intersection extrapolated to the voltage axis to
determine the dynamic decomposition voltage of
the
electrolyte.
The products were characterised by Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM, JEOL 5800), Electron Dispersion
Analysis by X-Rays (EDAX Oxford Instruments INCA
x-sight 6587) and X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD Phil-
lips X’Pert PW3020) and Inductively Coupled Plasma
Spectrophotometry Atomic Emission Spectrophotometry)
ICPAES (Varian axial Liberty Series II).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Sintering
Figure 2 shows an approximate inverse linear trend was
observed between sintering temperature and post-sintered
porosity. Tablets sintered at 1050 °C or less tended to form
powder when reduced, whereas those sintered at tempera-
tures greater than 1050 °C were of lower porosity but tended
to remain intact after the reduction. A maximum shrinkage
of 43 vol.% was observed when the sintering temperature
was 1300 °C, and just 8.5 vol.% when sintered at 900 °C.
3.2 Core parameter investigation
Table 1 summarises the experiments performed, visual
observations of the product, iron phase purity and other
phases present as determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.
In the latter, a semi-quantitative analysis was performed by
determining the scale factor for each of the analytical
peaks and comparing relative intensity ratios (RIRs) from
standard reference material spectra. A normalized RIR
method was used to determine the phase compositions.
3.3 Electrodeoxidation and salt decomposition
Table 1 shows that NaFeO2 spontaneously forms when the
Fe2O3 tablet is added to molten NaOH and so becomes the
starting material for electro-deoxidation:

The decomposition voltage at unit activity (Eo) of
NaFeO2 is 1.368 V assuming unit activity of Na2O in the
salt at 530 °C:
2NaFeO2 ¼ Na2Oð1Þ þ 2Fe þ 3/2O2ðgÞ
ð3Þ
The equilibrium constant Keq of the dissociation of
NaOH dictates the initial activities of Na2O and H2O:
2NaOHðlÞ ¼ Na2OðlÞ þ H2OðlÞ

The term ðaNaOH Þ2 is unity so that initially, aH2 O ¼
p ¼ 5.143  10 6 and based on the Lux-
Flood scale [4] the salt
is neutral. Allowing for the
presence of dissolved Na2O using the Gibbs function with
pure Na2O (the solute) as the standard state:
DG ¼ RT lnðaNa2O Þ
ð6Þ
The addition of this term to the DG° values enables the
DG for any reaction to be calculated and also the
decomposition potential from:
DG ¼  zFE
ð7Þ
where z is charge transferred, E is the potential and F is
Faraday’s constant. When the oxide tablet is added to the
salt, the local activity of Na2O will be low due to reactions
(1) and (2) and the salt becomes a strong Lux-Flood acid.
So E° for NaFeO2 is decreased and gradually increases
during electro-deoxidation as Na2O is regenerated as
shown in reaction (3). The activities of Na2O and H2O in
the salt will also dictate their respective decomposition
voltages and can be calculated in a similar way. There are
two electrolyte decomposition routes both sharing the same
reaction at the anode;

Table 2 summarises the calculated changes in salt
composition at 530 °C during electro-deoxidation and the
respective component decomposition voltages at various
H2O, Na2O and NaFeO2 activities. The activity of Na2O
under acidic conditions approaches zero which can be
inferred from the number of moles Fe2O3 in the tablet and
Eqs. 1 and 2. A Na2O activity of 10-11 was used based on
the work of Tre´millon [6] who states that in strongly acidic
solutions [H2O] and aH2O approach 1 where the ionic
product is 10-11.
Under strongly basic conditions the activity of the

1 wt.% Na2O in the salt was estimated from the phase
27 wt.% sodium oxide or mole fraction of 0.193 at the
saturation point X on the diagram. For a 1 wt.% addition of
sodium oxide, the mole fraction (X1 wt.%) of the solid is
0.00647. The free energy of freezing is given by:

Figure 4 shows the current–voltage plot to determine the
decomposition voltage of the electrolyte under strongly
basic conditions. The dynamic decomposition voltage (i.e.
the minimum voltage necessary to perform an electrolysis)
may be extrapolated from the intersection of line AB and
CD and yields a value of 1.80 V. This value will include
the charge transfer overvoltage and when the iR drop is
subtracted yields a value of 1.55 V.
Table 2 shows that hydrogen evolution will occur
concurrently with electro-de-oxidation under acidic and
near-neutral conditions. When Na2O is added, the H2O
decomposition voltage is increased to 1.64 V, beyond the
applied cell voltage of 1.70 V (1.45 V with iR drop
subtracted) raising the current efﬁciency. Sodium depo-
sition (1.36 V) might be expected to occur as well and yet
the current efﬁciency (*89%) and Fig. 4 suggests this
does not occur which may be due to signiﬁcant charge
transfer overpotentials on the ferrite cathode and the
nickel anode.
The current efﬁciencies are calculated and shown in
Table 1. It can be seen that with the addition of Na2O, high
current and energy efﬁciencies are obtained. Furthermore,
since neither hydrogen nor sodium will reduce NaFeO2 at
530 °C the mechanism of reduction must be ionisation of
oxygen and its transport out of the oxide into the salt and
subsequent discharge of O2 on the anode.
The current efﬁciency value of 89% is also supported by
Fig. 4 where the background current was *0.1 A at an

subtracted) there is insufﬁcient driving force to fully reduce
NaFeO2. At 1.70 and at 2.00 V without the Na2O addition,
hydrogen evolution parasitizes electro-deoxidation. At
1.6 V with Na2O addition, hydrogen discharge becomes
less dominant which raises the current efﬁciency, but as the
reversible voltage of NaFeO2 is approached the overvolt-
age becomes
important,
the cell current diminishes
resulting in longer reduction times.
3.4 Mechanistic considerations
Table 1 shows several intermediate phases based on Nax-
FeyOz which suggests NaFeO2 is not reduced in one step
but incorporates Na2O, Na2O2 and NaO2 into its structure.
The latter phases were also observed in the XRD analyses
of partially reduced sodium ferrite some of which are
presented in Table 1 implying that
the mechanism of
reduction is more complex than that observed with electro-
deoxidation of iron oxide in CaCl2 where CaO is the only
dissolved oxide. The transport of oxygen out of the oxide
lattice into the salt only occurs after the formation of
sodium ferrites and sodium oxide. This will happen
through a series of solid-state reconstructive transforma-
tions of
sodium ferrite species. Similarly,
calcium
metallites and metallates have been reported using CaCl2
[7, 8]. Note that:
[Na2O:2NaO2 :Fe2O3 ]  2Na2FeO4
[Na2O2 :FeO]  Na2FeO3
[2Na2O:FeO]  Na4FeO3
All of the above ferrite and oxide phases were detected by
XRD. This leads to two possible mechanisms of reduction:
Case 1 involving just Na2O:
[Na2O:Fe2O3  ¼ [Na2O þ 1/2FeO] þ 1/2Fe3O4 þ 1/4O2
[Na2O þ 1/2FeO þ 1/2Fe3O4 þ Na2Osalt
¼ [2Na2O:FeO] þ FeO þ 1/4O2
E ¼  0.668 V
FeO ¼ Fe þ 1/2O2
E ¼  1.099 V
[2Na2O:FeO] ¼ Fe þ 1/2O2 + 2Na2Osalt
E ¼  2.337 V
Overall: [Na2O:Fe2O3  þ (Na2O)salt þ 6e 
¼ 2Fe þ 3/2O2 þ 2Na2Osalt
ð18Þ
Case 2 involving Na2O and NaO2;
The oxygen rich elimination product NaO2 was repeat-
edly identiﬁed by XRD in the reduction products and may
form on the anode by oxidation of O2-:

4O2    6e  ! 2O 
2 (2NaO2 )
ð19Þ
The superoxide ion can migrate to the cathode and react
with sodium ferrite:
[Na2O:Fe2O3  þ 2NaO2salt ¼ [Na2O:2NaO2 :Fe2O3 ]
[Na2O:2NaO2 :Fe2O3  ¼ [Na2O:2NaO2 þ 1/2FeO
þ 1/2Fe3O4 þ 1/4O2
[Na2O:2NaO2 þ 1/2FeO þ 1/2Fe3O4 þ Na2Osalt
¼ 2[Na2O2 :FeO þ 1/4O2 þ 2/3NaO2salt þ 2/3Na2Osalt
2[Na2O2 :FeO] ¼ 2Fe þ O2 þ 4/3NaO2salt þ 4/3Na2Osalt
and is then eliminated from the ferrite and reduced back to
the oxide ion on the cathode:
2O 
2 (2NaO2 Þ þ 6e  ! 4O2 
Overall: [Na2O:Fe2O3  þ 2NaO2salt þ Na2Osalt
¼ 2Fe þ 3/2O2 þ 2Na2Osalt þ 2NaO2salt
ð21Þ
ð20Þ
It is not possible to assign decomposition voltages in
case 2 due to lack of thermodynamic data for this set of
sodium ferrites. The high current efﬁciency would imply
that the mechanism shown in case 1 predominates.
Tremillion [6] has shown that superoxides form partic-
ularly in Lux-Flood basic solutions of NaOH at sufﬁciently
high potentials on the anode. In terms of mass balance,
there is no net loss or gain from the electrolyte, just dis-
charge of oxygen removed from the iron oxide.
4 Conclusion
Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) was successfully reduced to iron in
molten sodium hydroxide at 530 °C by the method of
electro-deoxidation. The reduction can be performed below
the decomposition voltage of the electrolyte without dis-
charge of hydrogen or sodium by a prerequisite controlled
addition of sodium oxide (Na2O). The optimal operating
cell voltage is 1.7 V. The current efﬁciency of the cell
under these conditions was approximately 90%.
An inert nickel anode was successfully used throughout
all of the experiments, a thin but highly protective and
electronically conducting nickel oxide ﬁlm forming on the
surface.
The starting material for electro-deoxidation is NaFeO2
formed by spontaneous reaction of Fe2O3 with the elec-
trolyte. Below the decomposition voltage of the salt, when
electro-deoxidation is predominant, there is no net change
in electrolyte composition, the oxygen from the Fe2O3
being mass balanced by discharge on the anode by oxida-
tion of hydroxyl ions to form oxygen and water.
The mechanism proceeds by solid-state transformations

to Fe2+ to Fe with elimination of sodium oxide species
based on the general formula NaxOy into the electrolyte.
The terminal oxides are FeO and/or [2Na2O:FeO] and
[Na2O2:FeO] which are reduced directly to iron. The
overall reactions on the electrodes are:
Cathode: Fe2O3 þ 6e  ¼ 2Fe þ 3O2 
Melt: 3O2  þ 3H2O ¼ 6OH 
Anode: 6OH    6e  ¼ 3H2O þ 3/2O2
Overall: Fe2O3 ¼ 2Fe þ 3/2O2
Controlling the sodium oxide activity in the cell allows
the operating voltage window to be varied which may
allow oxides of metals less stable than H2O and Na2O (at
their residing activities) to be produced.
Scale-up of the process is very promising. The usual
problems associated with high temperature electrolysis
such as materials degradation and toxic gas emissions are
virtually eliminated with this cell. The power consumption
of the cell is 2.8 kWh kg-1 based on a cell operated at
1.7 V for 1 h. The current density was about 0.5 A cm-2
indicating that the rate of reaction was far higher than that
obtained in aqueous solutions. There is no CO2 output from
the cell compared to 1.18 ton CO2/ton iron for the iron
blast furnace based on the reaction:
Fe2O3 þ 3CO ¼ 2Fe þ 3CO2
and the whole process could be powered by renewable
sources.
