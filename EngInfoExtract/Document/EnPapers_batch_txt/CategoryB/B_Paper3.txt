Abstract
As a highly speciﬁc marker of tenocytes, tenomodulin (Tnmd) functions remain largely unexplored. We
investigated the effect of Tnmd overexpression on tenogenic differentiation of murine mesenchymal
stem cells (mMSCs) via plasmid-mediated overexpression in the C3H10T1/2 cell line. The results
showed that overexpressed Tnmd could signiﬁcantly enhance cell proliferation (p < 0.05) and the gene
expressions of tenogenic-related molecules, including Tnmd, Scleraxis (Scx), collagens I, III and VI and
decorin (p < 0.05), and signiﬁcantly inhibit mMSCs differentiation towards the adipogenic,
chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages (p < 0.05). Upon in vivo implantation with rat tail collagen gel
subcutaneously in nude mice, Tnmd-overexpressed C3H10T1/2 cells formed neotendon-like tissue,
which revealed a histological feature of wave-like dense collagen ﬁbres and cells aligned in parallel.
By contrast, a disorganized connective tissue structure with randomly distributed cells was observed
in the control group. To further conﬁrm this ﬁnding, a conditional Tnmd-overexpressing mouse model
was established and the derived primary mMSCs could be induced to overexpress Tnmd with > two-fold
upregulated gene expression (p < 0.05) by the treatment of doxycycline (Dox). Similarly, conditional
overexpression of Tnmd in primary mMSCs also led to faster proliferation (p < 0.05), enhanced gene
expression of tenogenic markers (p < 0.05) and the inhibited expressions of adipogenic and osteogenic
markers (p < 0.05). The results of enhanced tenogenic dif ferentiation and neotendon formation
indicated that Tnmd may ser ve not only as a tenogenic marker but also as a positive regulator
of MSCs tenogenic differentiation, which might be applied to MSCs-mediated tendon regeneration.

ﬁbroblasts (Cao et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2006; Deng et al.,
2009). Of particular interest is the use of mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) for tendon engineering, because of
their multi-differentiation potential (Pittenger et al.,
1999), including tenogenic differentiation potential and
the capability of regenerating functional tendons (Ouyang
et al., 2003; Hankemeier et al., 2009). Although various
molecules have been reported to be beneﬁcial
for
tenogenic differentiation (Hoffmann et al., 2006; Kuo
and Tuan, 2008; Sahoo et al., 2010), the search for a spe-
ciﬁc molecule that can not only serve as a marker of
tenocytes but also play a role in tenogenic differentiation
is obviously an area to be explored.
Tenomodulin (Tnmd) has been deﬁned as a highly spe-
ciﬁc marker
for mature tenocytes in the literature
(Brandau et al., 2001; Shukunami et al., 2001; Yamana
et al., 2001; Jelinsky et al., 2010). It is a type II transmem-
brane glycoprotein that is characteristically expressed in
dense connective tissues, such as tendon and ligament
(Brandau et al., 2001; Shukunami et al., 2001; Yamana
et al., 2001). Tnmd is mainly composed of a highly con-
served C-terminal domain with eight cysteine residues, a
BRICHOS domain consisting of a conserved sequence of
approximately 100 amino acids, and a putative protease
recognition site, RXXR. Cleavage at this site by furin re-
sults in the release of the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain
from the cell membrane into the extracellular matrix
(ECM) (Brandau et al., 2001).
Regarding Tnmd function, this remains largely unex-
plored. A study (Oshima et al., 2004) has shown that
the C-terminal
cysteine-rich domain has an anti-
angiogenic role, as its overexpression in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) inhibited cell prolifera-
tion and tube formation in an in vitro assay.
Its
overexpression in human melanoma cells resulted in sup-
pressing tumour growth in vivo, with decreased vessel
density (Oshima et al., 2004). Additionally, Tnmd-
deﬁcient mice exhibited severely reduced proliferation of
derived tenocytes and an altered collagen ﬁbril super-
structure, indicating that Tnmd is a regulator of tenocyte
proliferation and collagen ﬁbril maturation (Docheva
et al., 2005).
This evidence suggests that Tnmd may play a potential
role in tendon development and functional maintenance.
From a developmental biology point of view, MSC
tenogenic differentiation may partially represent the ten-
don development process (Bruder et al., 1994). Unfortu-
nately, the role of Tnmd in this process has not yet been
fully explored. Previously, gene transfection of MSCs was
applied to tendon engineering, e.g. Smad8 (Hoffmann
et al., 2006), Scleraxis (Alberton et al., 2012) and BMP12
and BMP13 (Haddad-Weber et al., 2010). In the present
study, we investigated the role of Tnmd in MSC tenogenic
differentiation and other lineage differentiations, and
neotendon formation primarily via its gene overexpres-
sion in an immortalized cell line of murine tendon-derived
progenitor TT-D6 cells and a murine MSC cell
line,
C3H10T1/2. In addition, the effect of Tnmd overexpres-
sion on MSC tenogenic differentiation was also validated
using murine bone marrow stromal cells (mBMSCs) de-
rived from conditional Tnmd-overexpressing transgenic
mice.

service. Brieﬂy, mouse Tnmd CDS (coding sequence)
was excised from pCAGGS–Tnmd plasmid (kindly pro-
vided by Dr Yuji Hiraki at Kyoto University, Japan), using
EcoRI digestion, and then inserted into pTRE vector
(pTRE-Tnmd) at the EcoRI site, using T4 ligase (New En-
gland Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Linearized pTRE-Tnmd
cDNA was microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized
zygotes of C57BL/6 mice, as described (Liu et al., 2013).
The eggs were implanted into a pseudo-pregnant ICR fos-
ter mother. Founder mice were identiﬁed by PCR as des-
cribed below, using the DNA isolated from the tails and
the primer (forward, 5′-GCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGA-
3′; reverse, 5′-CCGTCCTCCTCAAAGTCCTGTA-3′). The
pTRE-Tnmd transgenic mice were bred and mated with
STOCK Tg(rtTAhCMV) 4Uh/J mice (purchased from the
Model Animal Research Centre, Nanjing University,
China), which carried the gene encoding the reverse
tetracyline-controlled transactivator protein (rtTA) under
the control of a human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) early
promoter, and conditional overexpression of tenomodulin
could be induced with the addition of doxycycline (Dox,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in the culture medium. The
offspring were then bitransgenic and Tnmd overexpres-
sion could be induced by treatment with Dox. The trans-
genic mice were characterized by PCR using above-
mentioned primer for pTRE-Tnmd and a new primer for
rtTA (forward, 5′-CGCTGTGGGGCATTTTACTTTAG-3′;
reverse, 5′-CGTGTCCAGATCGAAATCGTC-3′). All experi-
mental protocols involving mouse experiments were ap-
proved by the Animal Care and Experiment Committee
of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.
2.2. Cell culture
Cells from the murine tendon-derived cell line TT-D6
(Salingcarnboriboon et al.,2003) and the murine MSC cell
line C3H10T1/2 (Hoffmann et al., 2006) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone,
Logan, UT, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. TT-D6 cells needed to be
cultured at 33 °C, as the cells harboured a temperature-
sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen in order to main-
tain their immortalized status (Salingcarnboriboon et al.,
2003). The culture medium was changed every 2 days
and the cultured cells were passaged when they reached
80% conﬂuence.
To obtain mur ine pr imar y BMSCs from the trans-
genic mice, 10 conditional Tnmd overexpression mice
were randomly selected and anaesthet ized with pen-
tobarbital (50 mg/kg), and the bone marrow cells
were har vested from the femurs by gr inding asepti-
cally, as previously descr ibed (Zhu et al., 2015). In
this study, three or four mouse-der ived BMSCs were
combined into one cell sample;
in total, three cell
samples were generated from 10 mice. The der ived
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml

Tenomodulin overexpression and MSC tenogenic differentiation
streptomycin. Af ter culture for 48 h, non-adherent
cells were removed by changing the medium. The ad-
herent cells were grown and sor ted by magnetic-
activated cell sor ting (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Ger-
many), using a mouse lineage cell depletion kit
(Miltenyi Biotec) as previously descr ibed (Lamour y
et al., 2006). The lineage-negative cells were consid-
ered to be mBMSCs. To induce the overexpression of
Tnmd, 5 μM Dox was added into the DMEM culture
medium, which was changed every 2 days.
To
assess
the multilineage
differentiation
of
C3H10T1/2 cells and mBMSCs in vitro, the cells were
plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates,
followed by a change of differentiation medium every
2 days. Differentiation media were prepared as previously
described (Chen et al., 2007): for adipogenic induction,
both cell types were cultured in adipogenic medium
(0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μM dexamethasone,
10 μM insulin and 200 μM indomethacin) for 7 days; for
osteogenic induction, both cell types were cultured in os-
teogenic medium (0.01 μM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3,
50 μM ascorbate 2-phosphate and 10 mM β-glycerol phos-
phate) for 21 days; and for chondrogenic induction, both
cell
types were cultured in chondrogenic medium
[50 μM ascorbate 2-phosphate (all reagents above from
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 10 ng/ml
transforming
growth factor-β1(TGFβ1; R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) and 50 ng/ml
insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1; R&D Systems)] for 21 days.
To induce chondrogenic differentiation in a pellet cul-
ture fashion, C3H10T1/2 cells were resuspended at
5 × 105 cells in 1 ml culture medium, then centrifuged
at 240 × g for 5 min to form pellets, according to a previ-
ously established protocol (Zhu et al., 2015). These pellets
were cultured in the above-mentioned chondrogenic me-
dium, which was changed every 2 days. After 3 weeks of
in vitro culture, pellet samples were evaluated by qPCR
and histochemical analyses.
2.3. Plasmid transfection
To achieve Tnmd overexpression, TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2
cells were transfected with pCAGGS–Tnmd plasmid as
the experimental group and an empty control vector,
pCAGGS (Yoshimura et al., 2009), as a control, using
Fugene HD (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), according
to the manufacturer ’s protocol. Brieﬂy, the cells were
plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates
until they reached >80% conﬂuence. Next day, transfec-
tion complex containing 2 μg linearized DNA and 6 μl
Fugene HD transfection reagent (1:3 ratio) was added
directly into the culture medium. To assure stable expres-
sion of Tnmd,
the cells were subjected to G418
(Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) selection at a con-
centration of 800 μg/ml immediately after the transfec-
tion. Individual surviving cell clones were picked up by
limiting dilution on 96-well plates. The clones were prop-
agated and conﬁrmed for Tnmd gene expression by RT–

PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Cell clones that dem-
onstrated the highest levels of Tnmd gene expression
were further conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuorescent staining
of Tnmd protein and propagated under the selected pres-
sure of G418 (400 μg/ml), and three cell clones with the
highest gene expression level were used for following
experiments.
2.4. RNA extraction and RT–PCR analysis
Total RNAs were extracted from TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2
cells transfected with pCAGGS–Tnmd or pCAGGS using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1 μg
RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, using AMV re-
verse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in a
20 μl reaction solution, including 4 μl 5× buffer, 4 μl
MgCl2, 1 μl oligo-(dT), 2 μl dNTP, 0.5 μl RNase inhibitor
and 0.5 μl AMV reverse transcriptase, using double-
distilled water to make up to the ﬁnal volume. The mix-
ture was then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for
60 min, 95 °C for 5 min and 5 °C for 5 min. The cDNA
was then ampliﬁed using a RT–PCR kit (Takara, Shiga,
Japan);
the primer sequences for detecting tendon-
related genes are listed in Table 1. PCR products were sep-
arated by agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer con-
taining ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.
β-Actin was used as an internal control. Similarly, total
RNAs were also extracted from C3H10T1/2 cells
transfected with pCAGGS–Tnmd or pCAGGS and these
cells,
after multilineage
differentiation
induction
(pCAGGS–Tnmd- or pCAGGS-induced), followed by re-
verse transcription. RT–PCR was also performed using a
RT–PCR kit (Takara); the primer sequences for detecting
multilineage differentiation-related genes are listed in
Table 2.
Total RNAs were also extracted from mBMSCs derived
from conditional Tnmd-overexpressing mice, cultured
without (TNMD–OE) or with (TNMD–OE + Dox) 5 μM
Dox, and from the induced Dox-treated (TNMD–
OE + Dox induced) or induced non-treated (TNMD–OE
induced) BMSCs after multilineage differentiation, and
reverse-transcribed. The cDNA was subjected to qPCR
analysis
for multidifferentiated
genes,
including
tenogenic genes; the primer sequences are also listed in
Tables 1 and 2.
2.5. qPCR
The qPCR procedure was performed using a Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (2×; Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) in a real-time thermal cycler (Stratagene
Mx3000PTM QPCR System, La Jolla, CA, USA), as pre-
viously described (Zhu et al., 2010). The mixture of cDNA,
PCR master mix, primers and double-distilled water was
incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, then with 35 cycles of
95 °C for 30 s, at annealing temperature (see Tables 1,
2) for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s and 95 °C for 30 s. Analysis of

der a ﬂuorescence microscope.
2.6. Immunoﬂuorescent staining
To conﬁrm Tnmd overexpression after transfection, TT-D6
and C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with pCAGGS–Tnmd or
pCAGGS were ﬁxed in 4% cold paraformaldehyde (PFA;
Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min
and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
Invitrogen) in PBS for 60 min, followed by incubation
with rabbit polyclonal anti-Tnmd antibody (1:200; kindly
provided by Dr Yuji Hiraki and Dr Chisa Shukunami
(Kyoto University, Japan) at 4 °C overnight. After three
washes in PBS, PE-labelled anti-rabbit secondary antibody
was added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The nuclei
were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
2.7. Cell proliferation assay
To evaluate the effect of Tnmd overexpression on the prolif-
eration of TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2 cells, the 3-(4,5-dimeth-
ylthiazol)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma)
assay was performed. Both types of cells, transfected with
pCAGGS–Tnmd or pCAGGS, were seeded on 96-well plates
at a density of 2000 cells/well, cultured for 6 days and
tested each day. In each well, 20 μl (5 mg/ml) MTT solution
was added and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C.
Then the MTT solution was removed and 150 μl dimethyl
sulphoxide (DMSO; Sigma) was added, followed by incuba-
tion for 10 min on a low-speed shaking table. The absor-
bance was measured at 490 nm wavelength, using an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Thermo

Tenomodulin overexpression and MSC tenogenic differentiation
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). The experiment was per-
formed in quadruplicate.
To evaluate the effect of Tnmd overexpression on
mBMSC proliferation, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo
Laboratories, Japan) was employed, according to the
user ’s manual. Brieﬂy, mBMSCs cultured with or without
5 μM Dox were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
2000 cells/well. Each group was cultured for 11 days
and tested every other day. At the testing time points,
10 μl CCK-8 solution and 90 μl cell culture medium, with
or without 5 μM Dox, were added and incubated for 2.5 h
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Then the absorbance at 450 nm
wavelength was measured using the enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent
assay
reader. The
experiment was
performed in quintuplicate and repeated twice.
2.8. Histochemical and immunocytochemical
analyses
To detect the effect of Tnmd overexpression on the
multilineage differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells and
mBMSCs, the related assays were performed including
oil red O, alkaline phosphatase (AKP), alizarin red and
collagen II staining.
The oil red O staining procedure was performed follow-
ing the manufacturer’s protocol (Genmed Scientiﬁc, Arling-
ton, MA, USA). Brieﬂy, cells after adipogenic differentiation
were ﬁxed with 4% cold paraformaldehyde for 10 min and
then incubated in 2% oil red O reagent for 7 min, followed
by washes with PBS, and then observed under a microscope.
The examination of AKP activity was done following
the manufacturer ’s protocol (Shanghai Rainbow Medical
Reagent, Shanghai, China). Brieﬂy, cells after osteogenic
differentiation were ﬁxed with 4% cold paraformaldehyde
for 30 s and then incubated in prepared AKP solution for
45 min. The procedure of alizarin red staining was done
following the manufacturer ’s protocol (Genmed Scien-
tiﬁc). Brieﬂy, cells after osteogenic differentiation were
ﬁxed with 4% cold paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then
incubated in alizarin red solution for 10 min.
To detect the expression of type II collagen (COL2), cells
after chondrogenic differentiation were ﬁxed with 4% para-
formaldehyde and blocked with 5% BSA in PBS, followed by
incubation with an anti-mouse type II collagen antibody
(1:100 in PBS; Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) at 4 °C over-
night. After three washes in PBS, type II collagen was de-
tected using the mouse EnVision+ system (Dako, Denmark).
For semi-quantitative analyses, three ﬁelds were ran-
domly selected for observation in each sample under a mi-
croscope in all above described procedures and repeated
in three samples.
2.9. Ectopic implantation and histological
examination
Twelve nude mice, 6–8 weeks old, purchased from the
Shanghai Laboratory Animal Centre (Shanghai, China)
Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
were involved in this study, and the animal study proto-
col was approved by the Animal Care and Experiment
Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of
Medicine. Brieﬂy, 10 million C3H10T1/2 cells transfected
with pCAGGS–Tnmd and pCAGGS were mixed with
mouse tail type I collagen gel (1.5 mg/ml; Shengyou,
Hangzhou, China) to prepare cell–collagen constructs
with length 1 cm and diameter 0.5 cm in a syringe. After
anaesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral
hydrate (10%, 100 μl/mouse), an incision was made in
the sacral area on each side of the dorsum and a subcu-
taneous pocket was created. A cell–collagen construct
was implanted into the subcutaneous pockets on each
side and the incision was sutured with Ethicon 5–0
(Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). At
30 days post-implantation, the mice were euthanized
and the implants were harvested for histological exami-
nation. Formed tissue samples of each group were ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. After dehy-
dration in a gradient of ethanols and embedding in paraf-
ﬁn, the tissue samples were sectioned at 5 μm and
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed,
as described previously (Wang et al., 2008), to examine
the tissue structure, especially the collagen ﬁbre forma-
tion and alignment.
2.10. Statistical analysis
All quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). The differences among different groups
were analysed using one-way ANOVA and a post hoc test
for the statistical signiﬁcance between two groups. Stu-
dent’s t-test was also used for statistical analysis of paired
groups. SPSS 11.0 software was applied to the analysis;
p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Tnmd overexpression in TT-D6 cells and
C3H10T1/2 cells
To conﬁrm the successful overexpression of Tnmd, RT–
PCR and immunoﬂuorescent staining were conducted.
As shown in Figure 1, RT–PCR demonstrated that Tnmd
was not expressed in TT-D6 cells and expressed at a very
low level
in C3H10T1/2 cells when transfected with
empty vector pCAGGS, with the current RT–PCR protocol.
After transfection with pCAGGS–Tnmd, a high level of
Tnmd gene expression was observed in both cells
(Figure 1, top). Similar results were also shown in immu-
noﬂuorescent staining, which demonstrated that Tnmd
protein was strongly expressed in both TT-D6 and
C3H10T1/2 cells
transfected with pCAGGS–Tnmd
(Figure 1C, D, G, H) when compared to pCAGGS vector-
transfected cells (Figure 1A, B, E, F).

TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2 cells transfected with pCAGGS or

contrast microscopy. No obvious differences in cell mor-
phology could be observed between two groups of cells,
all exhibiting a spindle shape and ﬁbroblast-like morphol-
ogy in both TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2 cells (see supporting
information, Figure S1).
To evaluate the effect of Tnmd on the proliferation of
TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2 cells, a MTT assay was per-
formed. As shown in Figure 2A, the proliferation was
obviously faster in Tnmd-overexpressed TT-D6 cells than
in control TT-D6 cells, with a signiﬁcant difference be-
tween days 2 and 6 (p < 0.01). Similarly, Tnmd-
overexpressed C3H10T1/2 cells also proliferated faster
than vector-transfected C3H10T1/2 cells, with a signiﬁ-
cant difference between days 2 and 6 (p < 0.01)
(Figure 2B).
qPCR analysis was performed to examine the gene expres-
sion of tendon-related markers. As shown in Figure 3, col-
lagens I (COL1), III (COL3) and decorin (DCN) were all
signiﬁcantly upregulated in their gene expression levels
in both Tnmd-overexpressed TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2 cells
when compared to vector-transfected cells. It was also
found that collagen VI (COL6) and biglycan (BGN) were
signiﬁcantly enhanced for their gene expression in the
overexpressed TT-D6 cells but not in the overexpressed
C3H10T1/2 cells. By contrast, the gene expression of
Scleraxis (Scx), a transcript regulator of Tnmd, was signif-
icantly upregulated in the overexpressed C3H10T1/2 cells
but not in the overexpressed TT-D6 cells (Figure 3). Collec-
tively, these results indicated that Tnmd overexpression
could promote the expression of tendon-related extracel-
lular components and promote the tenogenic differentia-
tion of C3H10T1/2 cells.

3.4. Effect of Tnmd overexpression on
multilineage differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells
To investigate the effect of Tnmd overexpression on the
multilineage differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells, the cells
were subjected to adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteo-
genic differentiation, following by qPCR analysis and his-
tochemical staining.
As shown in Figure 4A, before induction, adipogenic-
related genes,
such as adipocyte protein 2 (aP2),
adiponectin and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-α
(C/EBPα), were minimally expressed (pCAGGS), but
they were downregulated signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) by
overexpressed Tnmd (pCAGGS–Tnmd). Moreover, the
above genes increased dramatically in the control cells
(p < 0.01) after adipogenic induction (pCAGGS in-
duced), but
the expressions were inhibited by the
overexpressed Tnmd in the induced cells (pCAGGS–
Tnmd-induced), which were signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01)
lower than those of control cells. Oil red O staining
(Figure 4D, a–d) also showed that the adipogenesis in
the pCAGGS–Tnmd-induced group was lower than that
in the pCAGGS-induced group. The above results indi-
cated that Tnmd overexpression could inhibit
the
adipogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells.
As shown in Figure 4B, before induction, the expression
of chondrogenic-related genes, such as aggrecan, SRY-
related high-mobility group box gene 9 (SOX9) and type
II collagen (COL2), were minimally expressed in vector-
transfected cells (pCAGGS), but their expressions were
signiﬁcantly downregulated in Tnmd-overexpressed cells
(pCAGGS–Tnmd), with
a
signiﬁcant
difference
(p < 0.01). After chondrogenic induction, the expressions
of aggrecan, SOX9 and COL2 increased dramatically
(p < 0.01) in vector-transfected cells (pCAGGS–Tnmd).
Nevertheless, the upregulation of aggrecan and COL2,
but not SOX9, gene expressions were signiﬁcantly
inhibited by overexpressed Tnmd (p < 0.01) (pCAGGS–
Tnmd-induced).
Immunohistochemical
staining
also
showed that collagen II protein production was only

enhanced in induced control cells (pCAGGS-induced) but
not in the other three groups (Figure 4D, e–h). Collec-
tively, these results suggested that Tnmd overexpression
could inhibit
the
chondrogenic differentiation of
C3H10T1/2 cells.
To further conﬁrm the effect of Tnmd on chondrogenic
differentiation, a pellet culture model was also applied. As
shown in Figure S2 (see supporting information),
overexpressed Tnmd formed a tissue mass that had a rel-
atively loose structure, with apparently less matrix pro-
duction, when examined with both H&E and toluidine
blue staining. Furthermore, qPCR revealed that the gene
expression levels of COL2, Sox9 and Aggrecan were all sig-
niﬁcantly downregulated in Tnmd-overexpressed cell pel-
lets than in control cell pellets.
As shown in Figure 4C, before induction, expressions
of the osteogenic markers AKP, osteocalcin and Runt-
related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) were minimally
detectable and no signiﬁcant difference could be ob-
served between the groups, with or without Tnmd
overexpression (p > 0.05). After osteogenic induction,
the gene expressions of all these markers were signiﬁ-
cantly upregulated compared to pre-induction levels
(p < 0.05). In Tnmd-overexpressed C3H10T1/2 cells
with osteogenic induction (pCAGGS–Tnmd-induced),
upregulation of AKP gene expression was signiﬁcantly
inhibited compared to vector-transfected cells (p < 0.01)
and no signiﬁcant difference was observed for other two
osteogenic markers, Osteocalcin and RUNX2 (p > 0.05).
Histochemical staining also conﬁrmed that AKP activity
was signiﬁcantly inhibited in Tnmd-overexpressed cells af-
ter osteogenic induction (Figure 4D, i–l). However, Tnmd
overexpression seemed to have no effect on calcium nod-
ule formation, as revealed by alizarin red staining (Fig-
ure 4D, m–p).
3.5. Effect of Tnmd overexpression on ectopic
neotendon formation
To further examine the role of Tnmd in neotendon forma-
tion,
Tnmd-overexpressed
and
vector-controlled
C3H10T1/2 cells were respectively mixed with rat tail col-
lagen gel and implanted in vivo. The histology of the tis-
sues 30 days after implantation showed that implants
seeded with Tnmd-overexpressed cells (pCAGGS–Tnmd)
exhibited a porcelain-like white colour and a relatively
bigger tissue block, whereas the implants with control
cells (pCAGGS) showed a semi-transparent white tissue
with a smaller tissue volume (Figure 5A). Histologically,
H&E staining revealed that a wave-like dense collagen
structure was formed, with the cells aligned in parallel
with the direction of the collagen ﬁbres in the experimen-
tal implants, similar to tendon tissue structure (Figure 5D,
E). By contrast, in the control implants, no dense collagen
ﬁbres were observed. Instead, a disorganized connective
tissue structure with randomly distributed cells was ob-
served (Figure 5B, C).

3.6. Effect of Tnmd overexpression on cell
morphology and proliferation of mBMSCs
BMSCs derived from the conditional Tnmd-overexpres-
sing mice were cultured either with or without Dox
(TNMD–OE+ Dox or TNMD–OE, respectively) and were
observed under reverse phase-contrast microscopy. As
shown in Figure S3 (see supporting information), no obvi-
ous difference in cell morphology was observed between
the two groups in passage one cells cultured for 1 and
5 days. However, a CCK-8 assay showed that the prolife-
ration was obviously faster in mBMSCs cultured with
Dox (Figure 6A) than in cells without Dox in their culture.
3.7. Effect of Tnmd overexpression on
tendon-related marker expression in mBMSCs
As shown in Figure 6B, Dox-mediated conditional overex-
pression of Tnmd could signiﬁcantly upregulate the gene
expression of most tendon-related markers,
including
SCX, COL1, COL3, BGN and DCN, but not COL6. Particu-
larly, DCN expression was enhanced about four-fold rela-
tive to the control.

Tenomodulin overexpression and MSC tenogenic differentiation

from conditional Tnmd-overexpressing transgenic mice cultured with Dox (TNMD–OE + Dox) or without Dox (TNMD–OE)
3.8. Effect of Tnmd overexpression on the
multilineage differentiation of mBMSCs
BMSCs derived from the conditional Tnmd-overexpress-
ing mice were cultured either with or without Dox and
were subjected to adipogenic and osteogenic differentia-
tion. As shown in Figure 7A, after adipogenic induction,
the induced gene expression levels of aP2, peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and adiponectin
were inhibited signiﬁcantly in mBMSCs cultured with
Dox (with Tnmd overexpression) when compared to those
of mBMSCs without Dox (control). Meanwhile, oil red O
staining (Figure 7C, a, b) also showed that adipogenic po-
tency in mBMSCs cultured with Dox was weaker than that
of the non-Dox group, with a signiﬁcant difference in the
staining area (p < 0.01; see supporting information,
Figure S4 A). These results further provided evidence that
Tnmd overexpression could inhibit the adipogenic diffe-
rentiation of MSCs.
As shown in Figure 7B, after osteogenic induction there
was no signiﬁcant difference in the gene expression level
of AKP between two groups, in agreement with AKP stain-
ing, which also showed no difference (Figure 7C, c, d),
with no signiﬁcant difference in the staining area
(p > 0.05; see supporting information, Figure S4 B). Un-
like C3H10T1/2 cells, the gene expression levels of Runx2
and osteocalcin decreased signiﬁcantly in the mBMSCs
cultured with Dox group (Figure 7B), which also agreed
with the ﬁnding that alizarin red staining was relatively
weaker in the mBMSCs cultured with Dox group than in
the mBMSCs without Dox group (Figure 7C, e, f), with a
signiﬁcant difference in the staining area (p < 0.05; see
supporting information, Figure S4C). Overall, osteogenic
potential was inhibited in Tnmd-overexpressed mBMSCs.
4. Discussion
Adult stem cells are an important cell source for tissue en-
gineering and regenerative medicine, and BMSCs have al-
ready been employed for
tendon engineering and

regeneration (Ouyang et al., 2003; Juncosa-Melvin et al.,
2006; Hankemeier et al., 2009). From a developmental bi-
ology point of view, MSC differentiation towards a speciﬁc
lineage partially represents the developmental process of
this speciﬁc tissue type, such as tendon tissue (Bruder
et al., 1994). Therefore, mimicking tendon development
might be a good strategy for inducing tenogenic differen-
tiation of MSCs.
Scx and Tnmd are two key molecules that are involved
in the process of tendon development. Scx, a basic helix–
loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is expressed in
tendon progenitor cells and plays a vital role in tendon de-
velopment (Schweitzer et al., 2001; Brent et al., 2003).
SCX-null mutant mice exhibited severe disruption of
force-transmitting tendons during the differentiation and
condensation of tendon progenitors and during the orga-
nization of tendon matrix (Murchison et al., 2007). As a
transcription factor, its major downstream functional mol-
ecules for tendon development remain to be deﬁned, al-
though Tnmd is one of them (Shukunami et al., 2006).
The latter authors discovered that Tnmd expression was
closely associated with the appearance of tenocytes dur-
ing chick tendon development and was positively regu-
lated by SCX, and that retroviral overexpression of Scx
resulted in signiﬁcantly upregulated gene expression of
Tnmd in cultured tenocytes (Shukunami et al., 2006).
Recent research demonstrated that SCX delivery via lenti-
virus led to direct reprogramming of human MSCs into
tendon progenitors and a remarkable upregulation of
Tnmd expression (Alberton et al., 2012). Although Tnmd
was suggested to be a tenogenic biomarker, its functional
role in tendon development and formation remains to be
explored.
Studies have shown that Tnmd has an anti-angiogenic
role, as its overexpression in HUVECs inhibited tube for-
mation in an in vitro assay (Oshima et al., 2004), whereas
tendon is also considered to be an avascular tissue. Addi-
tionally, Tnmd-deﬁcient mice exhibited severely reduced
tenocyte density and signiﬁcantly varied collagen ﬁbril di-
ameters, indicating that Tnmd is a regulator of tenocyte
proliferation and collagen ﬁbril maturation (Docheva
et al., 2005). Tnmd, which is predominantly expressed
in tendons and ligaments, is a member of a new family
of type II transmembrane glycoproteins, whereas the
other family member, chondromodulin I (ChM-I),
is
highly expressed in cartilage and also has the anti-
angiogenic function (Shukunami et al., 2001; Oshima
et al., 2004). It is likely that these two molecules may par-
tially compensate for each other ’s function, and thus ten-
don remains able to develop in Tnmd knockout mice. A
similar example is mutual functional compensation be-
tween decorin and biglycan; both are members of the
small leucine-rich proteoglycans family (SLRP) and can
compensate each other in knockout mice (Yoon and
Halper, 2005).
In this study, the overexpression method was applied to
investigate the functions of Tnmd, especially its role in the
tenogenic differentiation of adult stem cells. Two cell lines
were employed in this study: one was TT-D6, the murine

tendon-derived progenitor cell
line;
the other was
C3H10T1/2, the murine MSC cell line. Interestingly, the
expression levels of tendon-related markers were signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced in Tnmd-overexpressed cell lines, includ-
ing collagens I, III and VI, biglycan and decorin and, most
importantly, scleraxis. Although there were some differ-
ences in the marker expression between two types of cell
line (possibly due to different developmental stages),
decorin, an important tendon matrix molecule, was up-
regulated signiﬁcantly in both TT-D6 and C3H10T1/2
cells (Figure 3). Decorin (DCN), as a member of the SLRP
family and also the most abundant tendon proteoglycan,
plays a key role in regulating matrix assembly because it
binds to almost all types of collagen (Yoon and Halper,
2005). Decorin-deﬁcient mice demonstrated coarse and
irregular collagen ﬁbril structure and reduced mechanical
properties in mature skin and tail tendons (Danielson
et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2006). Biglycan (BGN) is also a
member of the SLRP family and binds to ﬁbrillar colla-
gens. BGN-null mice also developed abnormal collagen ﬁ-
brils with smaller diameter and weaker tendons, which
exhibited reduced stiffness (Ameye et al., 2002). Zhang
et al. (2006) discovered that biglycan had a comparable
spatial localization with decorin and that biglycan expres-
sion increased substantially in DCN-null tendons, suggest-
ing a potential functional compensation between the two.
Differential expressions of SCX and COL6 were ob-
served in two cell
lines. SCX was upregulated in
C3H10T1/2 cells, whereas COL6 increased in TT-D6 cells.
This was because TT-D6 represents a more mature
tenocyte-like cell, which usually has a high level of endog-
enous SCX expression (Salingcarnboriboon et al., 2003).
COL6, often expressed in mature tendon, is a non-ﬁbrillar
collagen and regulates collagen ﬁbrillogenesis via interac-
tion with other extracellular matrix molecules, such as
COL1, BGN and DCN. COL6-knockout mice displayed a
disruption in ﬁbre assembly and ﬁbril formation associ-
ated with decreased mechanical strength of tendon tissue
(Izu et al., 2011). Comparatively, C3H10T1/2 cells as a
MSC cell line began to differentiate into cells with a
tenogenic phenotype or immature tenocyte-like cells after
Tnmd transfection, but they certainly were not mature
tenocytes. Therefore,
it is reasonable that collagen VI
was
not
signiﬁcantly
upregulated
in
transfected
C3H10T1/2 cells. SCX is often considered as a marker
for MSC tenogenic differentiation. The upregulated SCX
expression induced by Tnmd overexpression is consistent
with the prediction of
tenogenic differentiation of
C3H10T1/2 cells.
The above results demonstrated that Tnmd overexpres-
sion could promote MSC tenogenic differentiation by en-
hanced expression of
tenocyte markers.
Interestingly,
overexpressed Tnmd also inhibited other lineage differen-
tiations of C3H10T1/2 cells,
including adipogenic,
chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages, as shown in
Figure 4. The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study Group re-
ported that expression of Tnmd was strongly correlated
with body mass index (BMI) and was downregulated with
weight reduction (Tolppanen et al., 2007, 2010). Saiki

Tenomodulin overexpression and MSC tenogenic differentiation
et al. (2009) also discovered that Tnmd expression was
signiﬁcantly higher in obese than in lean individuals, and
was downregulated during diet-induced weight loss. Con-
sidering that Tnmd is an anti-angiogenic factor (Oshima
et al., 2004) and it is upregulated by myostatin, an anti-
adipogenic factor (Mendias et al., 2008), the increased
Tnmd in obesity may become a protective mechanism that
restrains the growth of new blood vessels during adipose
tissue expansion, as adipose tissue mass can be regulated
through the vasculature (Rupnick et al., 2002). It may also
inhibit adipogenesis, as shown in this study.
In addition to the experiments performed with cell
lines, we also further conﬁrmed the ﬁnding with primary
mBMSCs derived from conditional Tnmd-overexpressing
mice. As shown in Figure 6B, Tnmd expression was upreg-
ulated > two-fold after Dox treatment; this led to signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced gene expressions of SCX, COL1, COL3,
BGN and DCN. Similar to the cell lines, overexpressed
Tnmd could also signiﬁcantly inhibit adipogenic and oste-
ogenic differentiations of primary mBMSCs (Figure 7).
We also conﬁrmed that Tnmd overexpression promoted
cell proliferation in all three different cell types, TT-D6
and C3H10T1/2 cells (Figure 2) and primary mBMSCs
of conditional Tnmd-overexpressing mice (Figure 6A),
which was also consistent with the ﬁnding of reduced
tenocyte density in Tnmd-knockout tendons (Docheva
et al., 2005). The mechanism of Tnmd-mediated cell pro-
liferation remains unknown. In the future, a further de-
ﬁned signalling role of
this molecule may help
understanding.
Hoffmann et al. (2006) reported that activation of
Smad8 in C3H10T1/2 cells promoted tenogenic differen-
tiation and regeneration in an ectopic tendon formation
and Achilles tendon defect model. We also employed an
in vivo ectopic model to investigate the role of Tnmd
overexpression in neotendon formation in nude mice. As
shown in Figure 5, Tnmd-overexpressed C3H10T1/2 cells
were able to form neotendon-like tissue with a relatively
well developed collagen ﬁbre structure 30 days after
implantation, along with collagen gel matrix (Figure 5D,
E), which was similar to the tissue structure of a previous
report in which a neotendon-like tissue was formed
ectopically by C3H10T1/2 cells that were genetically
modiﬁed with GDF-8 and BMP-2 (Hoffmann et al.,
2006). We also tried the same experiment with primary
mBMSCs but failed, and this was likely due to the lack
of an effective method to deliver Dox to mBMSCs
in vivo.
References
In summary, by applying two cell lines and primary
mBMSCs derived from conditional Tnmd-overexpressing
mice, and in vitro and in vivo models, this study demon-
strated that Tnmd could promote tenogenic differentia-
tion of MSCs, and thus conﬁrmed that Tnmd is not
only an important biomarker for tenocytes, but may also
play an important role in tendon formation by enhancing
MSC tenogenic differentiation, which to our best knowl-
edge has not been reported previously. This ﬁnding
may have practical importance for tendon regeneration
and the translation of tendon engineering in the future.
More importantly, the underlying mechanism of
this
ﬁnding needs further investigation. Tnmd is a transmem-
brane protein and its ligands remain largely unknown,
except for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
Whether the intracellular segment of Tnmd has the func-
tion of signal transduction is also unknown. The regula-
tion of Tnmd by upstream genes, such as SCX and
GDF8, has been well
investigated (Shukunami et al.,
2006; Mendias et al., 2008; Alberton et al., 2012). How-
ever, how these upstream molecules regulate the gene
expression of downstream molecules such as collagens
and proteoglycans via tenomodulin remains to be ex-
plored in future studies.
5. Conclusions
Tenomodulin is a well-known biomarker for mature
tenocytes, but its functions remain unknown. This study
demonstrated that Tnmd overexpression could promote
tenogenic differentiation of MSCs and facilitate MSC-
mediated neotendon-like tissue formation in vivo. The in-
formation gained from this study will further enrich our
knowledge in tendon development and promote tendon
engineering and regeneration.
