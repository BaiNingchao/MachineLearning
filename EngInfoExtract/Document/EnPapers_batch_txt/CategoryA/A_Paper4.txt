Titanium oxycarbide (TiCxOy ) was successfully prepared by an electro-deoxidation of TiO2 /C composite
cathode in molten calcium chloride at 900 ◦ C. The composite cathode was prepared by adding an amount
of carbon into TiO2 powders. By using X-rays diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, it was found
that the presence of carbon resulted in changes in reaction mechanism and accelerated the rate of elec-
trochemical reaction. The results suggested that the electrochemical reduction of TiO2 /C composite was
the following: ﬁrstly titanium dioxide was reduced to TiOn (0 < n < 1) along with the formation of CaTiO3 .
Then, TiOn (0 < n < 1) reacted with carbon to TiCxOy .

1. Introduction
Titanium oxycarbide was found as an intermediate product in
the process of carbothermic reduction of TiO2 . It possesses some of
metallic properties such as good electrical and thermal conduc-
tivity, extreme high hardness and high melting point etc. Some
of works have been conducted on the preparation as well as the
performance of TiCxOy [1–9]. At present, TiCxOy has been attract-
ing more and more interest in scientiﬁc research due to its wide
use in decorative ﬁeld [1–3] and as an anode for electro-extracting
titanium [4–7].
Generally, there are two approaches to prepare TiCxOy. One is
the carbothermic reduction of TiO2 [4,5]. The other involves a heat
treatment of TiO and TiC at a relatively high temperature [6,7].
Both of approaches require high vacuum and high temperature. It
was also reported that TiCxOy ﬁlms could be made through several
methods such as by a gas–solid combustion [8]. Anyway, the harsh
conditions inevitably result in a high cost of production so far. It
is necessary to develop an alternative method to prepare titanium
oxycarbide with low-cost.
In the late 1990s, an electro-deoxidation technique was dis-
covered by the scientists at University of Cambridge. The process
has been used to successfully prepare numerous metals and alloys
directly from their respective metal-oxides in CaCl2 based molten
salts [9–26]. In this process, oxygen in the cathode is ionized and
transported to the anode via the electrolyte. If a conventionally
carbon anode is used, O2− will discharge to form CO or CO2 .

Recently, it has been reported the electro-deoxidation of Nb2O5
in the presence of additives such as carbon, CaCO3 or CaO to increase
porosity and the number of the O2− vacancies during the sinter-
ing process of the solid cathode [25]. The present work is focusing
on the preparation of titanium oxycarbide (TiCxOy ) by electrolyz-
ing a TiO2 /C composite in molten CaCl2 electrolyte. The composite
cathode was prepared by adding an amount of carbon into TiO2
powders. It is reasonable to expect that the presence of carbon will
provide more channels for the transmission of electrons, and elec-
trons accelerating the electrolysis. Thereafter, carbon involved in
the reduction process could form TiCxOy .
2. Experimental
Commercially available TiO2 (AR) and carbon powders (≥99%)
were selected as the starting materials. The powders were mixed
using mortar and pestle within a molar proportion of TiO2 :C = 2:1,
and thereafter uniaxially pressed into a pre-formed pellet (10 mm
in diameter), which was subsequently calcined in argon at 900 ◦C
for 6 h in order to give sufﬁcient mechanical strength for connect-
ing to be an electrode. The cathode was assembled by wrapping
TiO2 /C pellet by a nickel–chromium alloy wire (0.5 mm in diame-
ter) and then connecting to a stainless steel rod (6 mm in diameter).
A graphite rod with a diameter of 10 mm was used to be anode.
180 g CaCl2 (≥96.0%) was weighed and placed in a well sealed
vacuum drying oven (180 ◦C) for 24 h. Then, the preliminary pre-
pared salt was melted in an alumina crucible at 900 ◦C, which was
placed inside a vertical cylindrical tube furnace reactor. Throughout
the entire melting process, argon, which was used as the protective
gas, was constantly passed through the system.

TiO2 /C composite pellet, which is favorable for the penetration of
molten salts and the diffusion of ionized O2− during electrolysis.
On the basis of precisely controlling the molar ratio of TiO2 :C as
2:1, it can be speculate that pure TiCxOy (x = y = 0.5) could be syn-
thesized through electrolysis of TiO2 /C composite pellet. Indeed,
the oxygen and carbon content in the ﬁnal cathodic product was
measured, and the result reveals that the titanium oxycarbide syn-
thesized is TiC0.5O0.5 . The XRD result shown in Fig. 2 conﬁrms that
almost single phase TiCxOy is prepared after electrolysis for 12 h
[4–7].
A series of interrupted experiments were conducted to investi-
gate the electrolysis mechanism of TiO2 /C composite cathode, with
the electrolyzing durations ranging from 0 min to 12 h. Fig. 3 shows
that the XRD patterns of those as-prepared products obtained with
different electrolysis durations. XRD pattern (a) presents that a
small amount of CaTiO3 appeared in the sample quenched after
30 min of immersion without electrolysis. The results disclose that
some CaO remained in the molten CaCl2 even the salt has been
puriﬁed by a pre-melt process. It is known by the corresponding
Fig. 3. The XRD patterns of pellets electrolyzed for different durations. (a) With

After the pre-set temperature was reached, carbon anode was
immersed into the molten salt, subsequently the cathodic pellet
was slowly lowered into the electrolyte. Electrolysis was carried
out with a constant voltage of 3.0 V using a Solatron 1287 working
station.
When the electro-deoxidation was terminated, the sample was
lifted from the melt into the upper part of the reactor and cooled
naturally under the protection of argon. Then, the electrodes were
washed by distilled water and acetic acid to remove residual
salt within the pores of the cathode, and avoid subsequent frag-
mentation of the electrodes caused by hydration of the calcium
chloride. Finally, the samples were dried and characterized using X-
ray diffraction analysis (Model MAC, M21XVHF22) and a scanning
electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-6480LV) to identify the phase com-
position and microstructure of the cathodic products. Meanwhile,
the oxygen and carbon content of the products were quantitatively
analyzed by using Eltra ONH-2000 analyzer and HORIBA EMIA-
820V.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1a indicates XRD pattern of the sintered composite cathode
pellet in which all peaks visible correspond to TiO2 and C. The result
presents that no new phase is yielded during the sintering pro-
cess. The SEM photograph of the sintered composite pellet shown
in Fig. 1b suggests a compositional homogeneity, with respect to
the distribution of TiO2 and carbon. Porosity existed in the prepared

changed. With the addition of carbon, Magnéli phases such as Ti4O7 ,
Ti3O5 and Ti2O3 are rapidly skipped, and TiO2 is reduced to be TiO
directly. The rate of electro-reduction of the pellet was accelerated
greatly.

CaO at 900 ◦C to form CaTiO3 .

The product obtained with a 5 min of electrolysis is found to consist
predominantly of CaTiO3 and carbon, as well as a large quantity of
TiO (seen in pattern b). It suggests that TiO2 inside of the compos-
ite cathode could be directly reduced to be TiO. With prolonging
the electrolysis time as 1.5 h, a signiﬁcant result is found that the
product mainly comprises Ti2O, CaTiO3 and a new phase TiCxOy
(seen in pattern c). Two issues are noteworthy to mention: ﬁrstly,
TiCxOy shows up with respect to the disappearance of carbon. Sec-
ondly, carbon could not be involved in reaction until TiO2 is further
reduced to be Ti2O. The result suggests the following reactions:
TiO2 + (4 − 2n)e
− = TiOn + (2 − n)O2−
(0 < n < 1)
(2)
TiOn + xC = TiCxOn (0 < n < 1)
The electrolysis mechanism of TiO2 /C composite cathode has been
conﬁrmed by further prolonging electrolysis time up to 12 h. The
XRD results seen from pattern (d,e) shown in Fig. 3 indicates
that, with increasing the electrolysis time, the amount of Ti2O
and CaTiO3 gradually declined with more TiCxOy being identiﬁed.
Finally, TiCxOy is the almost single phase after electrolysis of 12 h.
Fig. 4 presents a typical current–time curve recorded during the
potentiostatic electrolysis at an applied voltage of 3 V, with the
molar ratio of TiO2 to C being set as 2:1. The curve indicates that the
current rapidly declines within 1.5 h following an initial peak, then
it continues to decline slowly until the electrolysis was terminated.
The typical shoulder trend may be attributed to the ionization of
oxygen in TiO2 to oxygen ions, corresponding to the TiO2 –TiO–Ti2O
reduction process shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The process can be
described by Eq. (2). On the other hand, the ionized O2− dissolved
in the melt and transferred via the melt to the carbon anode, on
which it combined with carbon to form CO2 /CO.
C + zO2− = COz + 2ze
The results suggest, in comparison of TiO2 electro-deoxidation
[17–19], that the existence of carbon causes the reduction
mechanism and the rate of electrochemical reaction have been

4. Conclusions
The preparation of TiCxOy directly from the electrochemical
reduction of TiO2 /C composite cathode in molten calcium chloride
at 900 ◦C was achieved. Compared with the electro-deoxidation
of pure TiO2 , the electrolysis of solid TiO2 /C composite cathode
was signiﬁcantly accelerated by addition of carbon. With a molar
ratio of TiO2 to carbon being 2:1, the single phase TiC0.5O0.5 can be
obtained via electro-deoxidation of TiO2 /C composite cathode. A
series of experiment, where samples were quenched experiments
were conducted to investigate the mechanism of the whole reduc-
tion process. It was found that the reduction of the cathode can be
divided into two steps: ﬁrstly titanium dioxide was reduced to TiOn
(0 < n < 1) along with the formation of CaTiO3 . Then, TiOn (0 < n < 1)
was converting to be TiCxOy by reaction with carbon.
