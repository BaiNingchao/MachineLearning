Abstract
Lithium reduction at a graphite electrode in molten lithium chloride was studied at temperatures from 650 to 900 8C using cyclic
voltammetry and chronoamperometry. It was found that, during cathodic polarization, lithium intercalation into graphite occurred
before deposition of metallic lithium started. This process was confirmed to be rate-controlled by the diffusion of lithium in the
graphite. When the cathodic polarization potential was more negative than that for metallic lithium deposition, exfoliation of
graphite particles from the electrode surface was observed. This was caused by fast and excessive accumulation of lithium
intercalated into the graphite, which produced mechanical stress too high for the graphite matrix to accommodate. The erosion
process was abated once the graphite surface was covered by a continuous layer of liquid lithium. These results are of relevance to
the mechanism of carbon nanotube and nanoparticle formation by electrochemical synthesis in molten lithium chloride. # 2002

1. Introduction
The electrochemical synthesis, i.e. the electrolysis of
molten alkali metal salts in the presence of a graphite
cathode, is one of the promising ways to produce nano-
sized carbon materials like tubes and particles in bulk
quantities, since the method is comparatively simple and
economic and also has the potential to be scaled up. The
process has been described in several publications [1 /4].
Thus far, it is known that the yield of nanotubes is
dependent on the salt and the temperature applied as
well as, in an interrelated manner, on the potential and
the current density. A further process parameter is the
reaction time, and it has been found that the yield of
nanotubes starts to decrease after a certain electrolysis
time [5].
In order to improve the process further, it is necessary
to understand the mechanism of carbon nanotube
formation in molten salts. Fray and coworkers [6,7]

related the generation of carbon nanotubes to the
intercalation of alkali metal into graphite, and proposed
a mechanism for the electrolytic conversion of graphite
into carbon nanotubes in molten salts. There is indeed
some experimental evidence that alkali metal intercala-
tion into graphite is an important step in the electro-
chemical synthesis [4,6], but a comprehensive and
detailed knowledge of the overall process is still lacking.
This paper reports an electrochemical investigation
into lithium reduction on a graphite electrode, using
cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry, with the
aim of elucidating the role of lithium intercalation into
graphite in the formation process of nano-sized carbon
materials in molten salts.

tion of metallic lithium onto the graphite surface.

The intercalation process may be represented by the
following equation.

The term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) denotes that
the lithium intercalated into graphite is to be considered
as the solute and the graphite as the solvent [8]. If the
reduction process is rate-controlled by the diffusion of
dissolved lithium in the graphite host lattice, with the
concentration gradient located on the graphite side of
the electrolyte j electrode interface, the corresponding
current may be derived as follows.
The time-dependent diffusion in one dimension under
semi-infinite linear transport conditions is described by

Because of the assumption of a reversible electrode
process, the lithium concentration in the graphite at the
electrolyte j electrode interface is governed by the
Nernst equation. It is suggested that, first, the concen-
tration of lithium ions in pure molten lithium chloride is
selected as the standard state for activity of lithium ions
and, second, the saturation concentration of lithium in
graphite is selected as the standard state for the activity
of lithium in graphite. With this, the concentration of
lithium at the surface of the graphite electrode can be
expressed by the following equation.

According to Eqs. (8) and (12), the relationships
between I (t ) and t1/2 as well as I (t ) and [(t/t )1/2/
t1/2] should be linear, and the absolute values of the
slopes should be equal for the same applied potential
provided the process of
lithium intercalation into
graphite is reversible.
Case II. Deposition of lithium onto the graphite sur-
face. If plain electrodeposition of lithium is the rate-
controlling process, the current is determined by the
electron transfer from the graphite onto the lithium ions
in the salt melt. This type of kinetics is governed by the
well-known Butler /Volmer equation and provides a
time-independent electric current.

Anhydrous lithium chloride was prepared by slow
heating to 250 8C and holding at this temperature for
more than 24 h in dry Ar. Experiments were performed
using a three-terminal electrochemical cell. The working
electrode (WE) was either a graphite rod of 6.5 mm
diameter, shielded in an alumina tube and connected to
a nickel
lead, or a molybdenum wire of 0.5 mm
diameter,
likewise shielded in an alumina tube. A

molybdenum wire was employed as
the reference
electrode (RE). A carbon crucible served as the con-
tainer for the electrolyte and also as the counter
electrode (CE). The electrochemical experiments were
carried out in a sealable and water-cooled Inconel†
reactor, positioned inside a programmable vertical tube
furnace.
First, the WEs were characterized by means of cyclic
voltammetry, applying scan rates of typically 100 mV
s1. Second, the WEs were subjected to double poten-
tial step experiments. The perturbation potential as a
function of time is sketched in Fig. 1. In order to
simplify the mathematical description of the electrode
process, a positive potential was initially applied, so it
may be assumed that, at zero time, neither lithium
dissolved in the graphite bulk nor lithium deposited on
the graphite surface were present. The perturbation
potential was then imposed for the time period A,
ranging from 0 to t , whereafter the potential was set
back to the original value for the time period B, ranging
from t to 2t . t was typically 300 s. During the periods A
and B, the current was recorded as a function of time.
The electrochemical measurements were conducted at
temperatures between 650 and 900 8C under dry Ar
using the Solartron SI 1287 Electrochemical Interface or
the Sycopel Scientific Powerstat. The stability of the RE
potential was confirmed by measuring the potential
difference between the molybdenum wire and a plati-
num wire in molten lithium chloride for more than 24 h.
In the following, all potentials are expressed with respect
to the molybdenum RE.
4. Results and discussion
Figs. 2 and 3 present cyclic voltammograms of the
molybdenum wire and the graphite rod WEs in molten
lithium chloride, respectively. Metallic lithium deposi-
tion on the molybdenum electrode occurs at a potential
of /1.9 V at 650 8C. Reversing the potential scan then
yields an anodic wave, which is typical for the stripping

of a previously adsorbed reaction product. The beha-
viour of lithium reduction on the graphite electrode is
different
from that on the molybdenum electrode.
Discharge of lithium ions on the graphite electrode
starts from potentials as high as /0.5 V at 650 8C. The
reason for this shift of
the discharge potential
to
considerably more positive values consists in the sub-
sequent dissolution of the lithium reduced into the
graphite bulk, a process that may take place at lithium
activities far below unity. This is in fact the same
phenomenon that causes the voltage degeneration in
lithium batteries when graphite serves as the anode
material
[8,9]. It is also found that the potential of
lithium reduction on the graphite electrode becomes
more positive as the temperature increases. A possible
reason is that the interaction between adjacent graphite
layers decreases with rising temperature, thereby facil-
itating the intercalation process.

electrode in molten LiCl to the double potential step of /1 V at
775 8C.
double potential step experiment of /1 V at 775 8C is
shown in Fig. 4. It is suggested that the first peak,
corresponding to period A, reflects the reduction of
lithium from the salt melt followed by intercalation of
the reduced lithium into the graphite bulk and that the
second peak, corresponding to period B, represents the
reverse reaction. However, according to Eq. (8), the It1/2
values measured during period A should be independent
of time, whereas it is found from Fig. 5 that these values
change with time within a short interval after applica-
tion of the potential, and this effect is more pronounced
when larger potential steps are applied. Indeed, such an
apparent discrepancy may be explained by means of an
ohmic resistance in the circuit
that
influences the
measurement despite the utilization of a RE [10]. This
resistance originates from the fact that the WE and the
RE are located on different equipotential lines, as a
result of which, the electrolyte resistance is only partly
eliminated in the three-terminal experiments performed.
Because of this ohmic resistance in the circuit, the

potential Ec that is actually applied to the graphite
electrode has to be expressed as
Ec  E  IRV
(13)
where RV is the uncompensated ohmic resistance. On
applying a potential step, the current changes quickly,
and this gives rise to a fast change in the potential drop
across the uncompensated ohmic resistance, too. For
relatively large changes, as is the case immediately after
application of the potential step and especially with
higher potential steps, the ohmic voltage drop lowers the
effective potential to a significant extent and causes the
measured currents to deviate from those expected from
Eq. (8). The relationships between ln(/It1/2) and I for
time intervals ranging from 2 to 40 s after imposition of
the potential are shown in Fig. 6. The slopes, which
should depend on the ohmic resistance in the circuit, are
linear and close to one another, and this is in agreement
with the fact that the ohmic resistance in the circuit
should be independent of the applied potential. When
either the current or the change of the current with time

becomes relatively small, the ohmic voltage drop is
either negligible or may be considered as a constant, and
then the relationship between current and time may
indeed be described in terms of Eq. (8).
Fig. 7 shows the relationships between the current I
and the reciprocal square root of time t1/2 measured
between 60 and 120 s after application of the various
potential steps during period A at 775 8C. Similar
dependences were obtained for all other temperatures
investigated between 650 and 900 8C. The slopes are
linear in all cases, which, in accordance with Eq. (8),
indicates that the reduction of lithium at potentials from
/0.5 to /1.4 V is rate-controlled by the diffusion of
intercalated lithium in the graphite matrix. Fig. 8 shows,
the corresponding relationships between I and [(t/
t )1/2/t1/2] for period B at 775 8C and, in agreement
with Eq. (12), the slopes are again found to be linear.
The absolute values of the slopes obtained from the
individual experiments during the periods A and B at
different potential steps are summarised in Table 1. In

lithium into the graphite and the deposition of elemental
lithium onto the graphite determine the current versus
time plots.
When the potential applied during period A is more
negative than /3.8 V, the current versus time plot
exhibits abrupt fluctuations of the measured current. As
becomes evident from Fig. 11, the higher the potential
step, the sooner occurs the onset of these current spikes.
It is thought that this current fluctuation is attributed to
the repeated exfoliation of graphite particles from the
electrode surface and the exposure of the fresh surface to
the salt melt. Indeed, the occurrence of erosion on the
graphite electrode during electrolyses carried out under
these conditions is clearly visible after the experiments.
Regarding the underlying reaction mechanism,
it is
straightforward to assume that, when a large amount
of lithium intercalates into the graphite electrode in a
short time, significant mechanical stress is generated
inside the graphite matrix. When the diffusion of lithium
is too slow to alleviate this stress,
the attractive
interaction between the graphite layers will eventually
be exceeded, which then results in the observed exfolia-
tion of graphite particles. As the lithium is present in
high quantities and distributed homogeneously among
the graphite layers, the exfoliated entities may be nano-
sized at least in one dimension and may act as the
precursors
in the formation of nano-sized carbon
materials like tubes and particles. Fig. 11 also illustrates
that, for potentials more negative than /4.4 V, the
exfoliation process may be abated after a certain
amount of time, giving rise to constant currents again.
The higher the potential step, the sooner this takes
place. The finding is associated with the rapid build-up
of a continuous film of liquid elemental lithium on the
graphite electrode surface. As liquid lithium does not
wet graphite very well, the mass transfer of lithium into
the graphite and thus the intercalation process are
slowed down, causing less erosion. It is likely that
both the potential dependence and the time dependence
observed in the lithium reduction at a graphite surface
under high potentials have a direct impact on the yield
of carbon nanotubes produced by means of this process.
5. Conclusions
From this study, it was found that lithium intercalates
into a cathodically polarized graphite electrode from
molten lithium chloride. When the potential applied to
the graphite electrode is more positive than that for
metallic lithium deposition,
the cathodic current
is
controlled by the rate of
lithium diffusion in the
graphite. The process of
lithium intercalation into
graphite was found to be almost reversible within the
investigated temperature range from 650 to 900 8C.
When the potential applied is more negative than that

centration gradient generated inside
the graphite.
Within experimental error, the slopes obtained for the
periods A and B for corresponding experiments are
fairly similar, so it can be concluded that
lithium
intercalation into graphite is an almost
reversible
process within the temperature range examined.
Figs. 9 and 10 show the relationships between I and
t1/2 for the potential steps from /2.0 to /3.8 V
at 700 8C and from /1.4 to /3.6 V at 775 8C,
respectively. The absolute values of the slopes decrease
with increasing potential steps, and at around /3.6 V
the current becomes independent of time. This time-
independent current is interpreted as the formation of a
layer of elemental lithium on the surface of the graphite
electrode, which is considered to be a simple electron
transfer reaction, whilst the current associated with the
intercalation process becomes negligible and no longer
influences the current versus time behaviour. Accord-
ingly, the potential range between /2.0 and /3.6 V is
an intermediate range, in which both the intercalation of

for metallic lithium deposition, exfoliation of graphite
particles from the electrode surface occurs due to
excessive lithium accumulation, causing destruction of
the graphite matrix. The degree of exfoliation decreases
when the graphite surface is covered completely by a
layer of liquid lithium. The findings are of relevance to
the preparation of nano-sized carbon materials with this
method.
