Tenomodulin (TNMD) is a type II transmembrane protein that is widely expressed in a variety of avascular con-
nective tissues and fat tissue. Its function remains largely unknown except for a marker for mature tenocytes. This
study reports the generation of tetracycline (Tet)-on driven conditional TNMD overexpressing mice and thus to
provide a tool for systemic investigation of its role in regulating functions of various tissues. The current study
focuses on in vitro comparison of tenogenic differentiation potentials induced by doxycycline (Dox) treatment
among bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs), adipose derived stem cells (ASCs), dermal ﬁbroblasts (DFs)
and tenocytes (TCs) of the same transgenic mice. The results showed that BMSCs exhibited the best tenogenic
potential than other three cell types (p b 0.05 for majority of markers), whereas ASCs and DFs revealed similar
potentials (p N 0.05 for majority of markers). TCs were found the least capable of being induced for tenogenic
gene expression. In addition, TNMD overexpression also signiﬁcantly inhibited the differentiation towards oste-
ogenic and chondrogenic lineages in both BMSCs and ASCs (p b 0.05). However, the inhibition of adipogenic dif-
ferentiation was not observed in ASCs (p N 0.05), suggesting different gene regulation mechanisms may involve
in different tissue types and thus leading to different functions, which is likely to be revealed with a transgenic
mouse model.

1. Introduction
Tenomodulin (TNMD) is a type II transmembrane surface molecule
that is composed of a highly conserved C-terminal domain with eight
cysteine residues, a BRICHOS domain which is composed of a conserved
sequence of approximately 100 amino acids and a putative protease rec-
ognition site RXXR. Cleavage at this site by furin results in the release of
C-terminal cysteine-rich domain from the cell membrane into the extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) (Brandau et al., 2001). TNMD is mainly expressed
in avascular tissues in general and particularly in dense connective tis-
sue such as tendon/ligament, heart valve and eye (Oshima et al.,
2003). Interestingly, this molecule is also highly expressed in fat tissue
(Saiki et al., 2009), an anatomic location exceptional from its principal
distributed tissue types.
The functions of TNMD are relatively unexplored. Previous reports
indicated that the extracellular part of this molecule, C-terminal cyste-
ine-rich domain, has an anti-angiogenesis effect. Its overexpression in
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) inhibited cell prolifer-
ation and tube formation in an in vitro assay (Oshima et al., 2003;
Oshima et al., 2004). In addition, this molecule is also expected to

participate in fat metabolism regulation (Tolppanen et al., 2008; Saiki et
al., 2009; Senol-Cosar et al., 2016).
Tenogenic differentiation is one of the areas of mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) research, which may potentially be translated into tendon
regeneration (Yin et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2016; Lu et
al., 2016; Yin et al., 2016). MSCs are also the potential source of cell ther-
apy for tendon injury (Docheva et al., 2015; Gaspar et al., 2015). In ad-
dition to MSCs, certain types of mature and differentiated somatic
cells, such as dermal ﬁbroblasts (DFs), are also possible to be
transdifferentiated into a tenogenic phenotype and thus potentially be
used for tendon regeneration (Liu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2016; Wang
et al., 2016). And despite the disadvantages such as limited resource
and poor proliferation, functional tenocyte-based tendon engineering
had been successfully produced (Wang et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2016).
It thus would be interesting to investigate how overexpressed TNMD af-
fects the behavior of multiple cell types and what is the difference in
their functions given the same stimulator to different cell types.
Transgenic mouse model is a widely used methodology to investi-
gate the role of a single molecule in directing functions of multiple cell
types. However, overexpression of certain molecule including TNMD
will have an embryonic lethal effect and also the difﬁculty to regulate
the transgene expression level, and thus limits its application. The de-
velopment of conditional overexpressing transgenic mouse driven by
an inducible promoter systems such as tetracycline (Gossen and
Bujard, 1992), ecdysone (No et al., 1996), steroids (Burcin et al., 1999)
and rapamycin (Ye et al., 1999) are likely to overcome the undesirable
shortcomings of the traditional transgenic mouse model. The tetracy-
cline (Tet)-inducible gene regulation system is a powerful tool that al-
lows for temporal and dose-dependent regulation of target transgene
expression in vitro (Gossen and Bujard, 1992; Rabiee et al., 2014) and
in vivo (Furth et al., 1994; Jazwa et al., 2013). For example, Runt-related
transcription factor 2 (Runx2) overexpressing mice displayed
multiorgan abnormalities, including ectopic calciﬁcation and induction
of the osteogenic program in a limited number of tissues, such as muscle
and lung (He et al., 2011). The Tet-On system comprises two key com-
ponents: the doxycycline (Dox)-dependent regulator, such as reverse
tetracycline Transcriptional Activator (rtTA), and the response element
containing the target gene, such as pTRE-X. The Tet-On system usually
contains integrated copies of the regulator and response plasmids in
order to create a double-stable transgenic mice line (Kistner et al.,
1996).
Previously, we described a Tet-On transgenic TNMD mice that ubiq-
uitously expresses rtTA driven by human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)
early promoter (Jiang et al., 2016), which was used to support the role
of TNMD overexpression in driving MSC tenogenic differentiation. We
hypothesized that overexpression of TNMD gene in an overexpressing
animal model will exert different functions among different cell types.
In this study, we employed the same model to examine the difference
in tenogenic lineage differentiation potentials among bone marrow de-
rived stem cells (BMSCs), adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and DFs
using tenocytes (TCs) as a positive control, given the same
overexpressed gene, TNMD.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Generation the pTRE TNMD transgenic mouse line
Generation of conditional TNMD overexpression mice was brieﬂy
mentioned previously (Jiang et al., 2016) and more detailed description
was provided in this study. In the process, pCAGGS-TNMD plasmid was
kindly provided by Dr. Yuji Hiraki at Kyoto University, Japan. After sufﬁ-
cient ampliﬁcation, mouse TNMD coding sequences (CDS) were excised
from pCAGGS-TNMD plasmid using EcoRI digestion, and then inserted
into pTRE vector at EcoRI site using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Ips-
wich, MA) resulting in pTRE-TNMD plasmid. Then, the plasmid was lin-
earized followed by the microinjection into the pronucleus of fertilized
zygotes of C57BL/6 mice as described (Conner, 2004; Liu et al., 2013).
A pseudo-pregnant ICR foster mother served as a rec ip ient for
the egg implantation (This work was performed by Model Animal
Research Center , Nanj ing Un ivers ity as a commerc ia l techn ica l
serv ice) to generate the founder pTRE-TNMD mice . To ident ify
founder (F0) transgenic mice, tail biopsies were collected from the
animals aged from two to three weeks for genomic DNA isolation
us ing Gentra Puregene Mouse Tai l Kit (Qiagen) . The generated
founder mice were further screened by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) analysis of the DNA derived from pTRE-TNMD mouse tails using
specially designed primers (forward: 5-GCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTCAGA-3
and reverse: 5-CCGTCCTCCTCAAAGTCCTGTA-3). Each founder (F0)
mouse was given a speciﬁc number and bred with wild type C57BL/6
mouse but never crossed each other. Then the tails of each founder's
offspring were collected and identiﬁed by PCR as previous described
(Jiang et al., 2016). The positive offspring mice of each founder were
mated each other to reproduce the next generation and the process was
repeated until the positive rate reached 100%. All experimental protocols
involving mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ex-
periment Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.
2.2. Generation of conditional TNMD overexpressing mice
Subsequently, conditional TNMD overexpressing mice were gener-
ated by breeding pTRE-TNMD mice with STOCK Tg (rtTAhCMV) 4Uh/J
mice (purchased from Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing Univer-
sity, China). To identify the conditional TNMD overexpressing mice
that carried the gene encoding rtTA under the control of a hCMV early
promoter, the ﬁnally generated bitransgenic mice were characterized
by PCR using above mentioned primer for pTRE-TNMD and a new prim-
er for rtTA (forward: 5-CGCTGTGGGGCATTTTACTTTAG-3 and reverse:
5-CATGTCCAGATCGAAATCGTC-3). All experimental protocols involving
mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Experiment
Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.
2.3. Induction of TNMD overexpression with Dox treatment
In all experiments, four types of cells derived from the conditional
TNMD overexpressing mice were tested for conditional TNMD gene
overexpression with the addition of 5 μM Dox (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) in culture medium.
2.4. Harvest and in vitro culture of BMSCs
To obtain murine primary BMSCs from the transgenic mice, 10 con-
ditional TNMD overexpressing mice aged from 3 to 4 weeks old were
randomly selected and sacriﬁced via excessive anesthesia, and the
bone marrow cells were harvested from the femurs by grinding and
rinsing aseptically as previously described (Zhu et al., 2015). In this
study, BMSCs derived from 3 to 4 mice were combined into one cell
sample, total 3 cell samples were generated from 10 mice. The derived
cells were cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium
(DMEM) (Hyclone, Logan City, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin. After culture for 48 h, non-adherent cells
were removed by changing the medium. The adherent cells were
grown and sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany) using a mouse lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany) as previously described (Zhu et al., 2015). The lineage
negative cells were considered as BMSCs and seeded at a density of
2 × 104 cells/cm2. To induce the overexpression of TNMD, 5 μM Dox
was added into the DMEM culture medium with medium change
every 2 days.

To obtain murine primary ASCs from the transgenic mice, 20 trans-
genic mice aged from 6 to 8 weeks old were randomly selected and
sacriﬁced as previously described. ASCs derived from 6 to 7 mice were
combined into one cell sample, total 3 cell samples were generated
from 20 mice. Brieﬂy, subcutaneous adipose tissues were harvested
from the inguinal and armpit areas, cut into small fragments and
digested with 0.075% (w/v) collagenase (NB4, Serva, France) in
serum-free low glucose DMEM at 37 °C for 2 h. The cell suspension
was harvested and ﬁltered through a 40-μm nylon ﬁlter mesh (BD Fal-
con, Bedford, MA) to remove tissue residues. The cells were seeded
onto 10-cm dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 for primary culture
and 2 × 104 for subculture. Cell culture medium was consisted of DMEM
plus 10% FBS with or without 5 μM Dox, and changed every 2 days.
The assessing of multi-lineage differentiation of ASCs in vitro was
described previously (Xiong et al., 2015). The cells were seeded at a
density of 1 × 105 cells per well in six-well plates followed by the
change of differentiation media every 2 days. The differentiation
media were prepared as below described.
For osteogenic induction, non-induced or Dox-induced cells were
cultured in osteogenic medium (0.01 μM 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin
D3,Sigma, St Louis, MO), 50 μM ascorbate-2-phosphate (Sigma, St
Louis, MO) and 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for
21 days. Total 5 views (× 100) were randomly selected from 3 cell sam-
ples and subjected to quantitative analysis of Alizarin Red staining area
with Image-Pro Plus processing software (version 6.0, Media Cybernet-
ics, Silver Spring, MD). Mean plus standard deviation was derived from
the data of ﬁve views.
To induce chondrogenic differentiation in a pellet culture fashion,
ASCs were resuspended to 5 × 105 cells in 1 ml culture medium, then
centrifuged at 240g for 5 min to form pellets according to a previously
established protocol (Zhu et al., 2015). These pellets were cultured in
chondrogenic medium (50 μM ascorbate-2-phosphate, Sigma, St Louis,
MO), 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3, R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) and 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and the medium was changed every
2 days. After 3 weeks of in vitro culture, pellet samples were evaluated
by qPCR and histochemical analyses. Total 3 histology samples respec-
tively derived from 3 pellet samples were subjected to quantitative
analysis of Alcian Blue staining area with Image-Pro Plus processing
software. Mean plus standard deviation was derived from the data of
three views.
For adipogenic induction, both Dox treated and non-treated cells
were cultured in adipogenic medium (0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine
(Sigma, St Louis, MO), 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma, St Louis, MO),
10 μM insulin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and 200 μM indomethacin
(Sigma, St Louis, MO)) for 10 days. Total 5 views (× 100) were randomly
selected from 3 cell samples and subjected to quantitative analysis of Oil
Red staining area with Image-Pro Plus processing software. Mean plus
standard deviation was derived from the data of ﬁve views.
2.6. Harvest and in vitro culture of DFs
DFs derived from 6 to 7 mice aged from 6 to 8 weeks were combined
into one cell sample, and total 3 cell samples were generated from 20
sacriﬁced transgenic mice. Skin tissue from back of the mice was har-
vested and cut into strips in the width of 5 mm. To separate epidermis
and dermis, the skin tissue was treated with 0.2% dispase (Roche Diag-
nostics, Indianapolis, IN) at 4 °C overnight followed by mechanical sep-
aration of dermis and epidermis. The dermis was then cut into small
pieces and treated with 0.2% collagenase in serum-free high glucose
DMEM on a rotator at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were cultured with high
glucose DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS at a density of
3 × 104 cells/cm2. Culture medium with or without 5 μM Dox was
changed every 2–3 days for cell expansion and further experiments.
Total 20 transgenic mice aged from 6 to 8 weeks were included. TCs
derived from 6 to 7 mice were combined into one cell sample, and total
3 cell samples were generated from 20 mice. Brieﬂy, ﬂexor tendons
were harvested from hind limbs, collected, and surrounding soft tissues
were carefully removed. The harvested tendons were minced and sub-
jected to enzyme digestion with 0.2% collagenase in serum-free high
glucose DMEM on a rotator at 37 °C for 2 h. After being ﬁltered through
a 40-μm ﬁlter mesh, the isolated primary TCs were seeded with high
glucose DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS at a density of
1 × 106 cells/cm2 for primary culture, and 5 × 105 cells/cm2 for subcul-
ture. Culture medium with or without 5 μM Dox was changed every 2–
3 days for cell expansion and further experiments.
2.8. Cell morphology analysis
As previously described (Wang et al., 2016), both Dox-induced and
non-induced cells of all four cell types were observed under phase-con-
trast microscope (Nikon, Japan) and 3 views of high power magniﬁca-
tion (× 100) were randomly selected from each group, in which 20
cells were randomly selected from each view and analyzed with
Image-Pro Plus processing software (version 6.0, Media Cybernetics, Sil-
ver Spring, MD). The analyzed characters included cell area, cell body
aspect (length/width ratio) cell length and cell width. All measurements
were performed on 20 cells per view and total 3 views of each group
were measured to generate means and standard deviation.
2.9. Cell proliferation assay
Passage 3 of all four different cell types were seeded in 24-well plate
at a density of (1–2) × 104 cells/well. Culture medium with or without
5 μM Dox was changed every 2 days. At days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, cells
in quadruplicate wells of each group were digested with 0.05% or
0.25% trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and counted separately. The
assay was repeated in 3 cell samples for each group.
2.10. RNA extraction and qPCR assay
Total RNAs were extracted respectively from different types of cells
at passage 3, which were cultured with or without Dox for 7 days
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for examining tenogenic
gene expression. Or the cells were harvested at desired time points for
tri-lineage differentiation as described in Section 2.5. Brieﬂy, 2 μg RNA
was reversely transcribed into cDNA with AMV reverse transcriptase
(Promega, Madison, WI) in a 20-μl reaction solution including 4 μl 5 ×
buffer, 1 μl oligo-(dT), 2 μl dNTP, 0.5 μl RNase inhibitor and 0.5 μl AMV
reverse transcriptase, using ddH2O to meet the ﬁnal volume. To tran-
scribe cDNAs, the mixture was incubated at 30°Cfor 10 min, 42 °C for
60 min, and 95 °C for 5 min (Wang et al., 2015).
A Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (2 ×) (Applied Biosystems, Fos-
ter City, CA) and a real-time thermal cycler (stratagene Mx3000PTM
QPCR System, La Jolla, CA) were employed to perform quantitative
PCR (qPCR) analysis. The mixture of cDNA, PCR master mix, primers
and ddH2O was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, then with 40 cycles of
95 °C for 30 s, at annealing temperature (see Table 1) for 30 s, 72 °C
for 45 s and 95 °C for 30 s. Analysis of each gene expression was con-
ducted in triplicate, repeated in three samples and was normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression by
using 2−ΔΔC(t) method.
2.11. Comparison of relative gene expression levels among four cell types
To compare the tenogenic differentiation or transdifferentiation po-
tential among four cell types, the gene expression levels of each Dox-in-
duced cell group were normalized to non-induced group with the same

cell type separately. The relative gene level of non-induced group of
each cell type was set as 1, so that relative expression level of one
gene could be compared among four cell groups that were induced for
TNMD overexpression with Dox.
2.12. Cell colony forming efﬁciency assay
Colony forming efﬁciency assay was performed as previously de-
scribed (Xiong et al., 2015). Passage 3 ASCs with or without Dox-induc-
tion were respectively seeded with DMEM plus 10% FBS on 10-cm
dishes (10 dishes for each group) at a density of 2000 cells per dish. Cul-
ture medium was changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks of culture, the
cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal vi-
olet and the number of colonies with diameter ≥ 2 mm was counted.
2.13. Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software
SPSS (version 19.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data are presented as mean and
standard deviation. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis of
all paired comparisons and one-way ANOVA test was used to analyze
differences among different groups. Student-t-test was also used to an-
alyze the difference of paired groups. A p-value b 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of TNMD transgenic mouse
The pTRE-TNMD plasmid (Fig. 1A) was injected into pronucleus of
fertilized zygotes of C57BL/6 mice. The injected embryos divided and
then produced 2-cell embryos after overnight culture and these were
transferred to the oviducts of 3 pseudopregnant female C57BL/6 mice.
These transferred embryos resulted in 41 live progeny and PCR results
indicated that 8 (19.5%) of these carried pTRE-TNMD transgene includ-
ing founders No. 3, No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, No. 28, No. 29, No. 31 and No. 37
(Fig. 1B, Table 2). During the further breeding, some founders failed to
give offspring mice that carried the transgene due to various causes,
and only founders No. 7 and No. 9 succeeded (Table 2). Following the
progress of the mice reproduction, the positive rate of pTRE-TNMD de-
tected by RT-PCR increased gradually, and reached 100% positive after
ninth generations of reproduction derived from No. 7 and No. 9 founder
mice. The ﬁnally generated conditional TNMD overexpressing mice pos-
itive for bitransgenes (pTRE-TNMD and rtTA) revealed no obvious ab-
normal phenotype when compared to pTRE-TNMD transgene mice
(Fig. 1C, D). More importantly, all four types of cells (BMSCs, ASCs, DFs
and TCs) derived from the double-transgene mice exhibited conditional
TNMD overexpression temporally induced by Dox and well controlled
in a dose-depended manner in vitro (data not showed), and 5 μM was
selected as the optimal dosage for various experiments based on prima-
ry tests.
3.2. No effect on cell morphology by conditional TNMD overexpression
To observe the effect of induced TNMD overexpression on cell mor-
phology, four types of cells were cultured on the dishes. As shown in Fig.
2A, after 7 days of culture without or with 5 μM Dox-induction, micro-
scopic observation revealed no obvious cell morphological difference
between induced and non-induced cells. The BMSCs exhibited relatively
heterogeneous cell shapes in both Dox-induced and non-induced
groups. Among them, most cells exhibit polygon cell shape along with
some small sized and light reﬂected cells. The cultured ASCs revealed
relatively homogenous cells, which are relatively smaller. By contrast,
both TCs and DFs showed homogenous morphology of spindle shape

To further provide quantitative supporting data, Dox-induced and
non-induced cells of each cell type were analyzed for their morpholog-
ical parameters. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no signiﬁcant difference
between Dox-induced and non-induced cells in cell area, cell body as-
pect, cell length and cell width for all four cell types (p N 0.05), except
for cell area of TCs (p b 0.05).
3.3. Conditional TNMD overexpression promoted cell proliferation
Passage 3 cells were cultured in 24 well-plate at the density of (1–
2) × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, and the cells
were collected every other days for total 11 days and counted. As
shown in Fig. 2B–E, all cell types except for DFs revealed enhanced cell
proliferation after Dox induction, with signiﬁcant difference in total
cell number between Dox-induced and non-induced groups (p b 0.05)
at most of the examined time points.
3.4. Conditional TNMD overexpression promoted differentiation and
transdifferentiation towards tenogenic lineage
In this study, scleraxis (SCX), collagens I (COL1), III (COL3) and VI
(COL6), decorin (DCN) and tenascin-C (TNC) were used as the teongenic
markers to examine this particular lineage differentiation. As shown in
Fig. 4, after Dox induction for 7 days, both BMSCs (Fig. 4A) and ASCs
(Fig.4B) showed more than two folds of up-regulated gene expression
level of TNMD when compared to non-induced cells (p b 0.01), indicat-
ing the success of this transgenic animal model. Relatively, the TNMD
gene expression levels were less up-regulated in both TCs (p b 0.01,

3.5. MSCs exhibited more potent tenogenic differentiation potential than
mature differentiated cells
The relative gene expression levels of tenogenic markers were com-
pared among four different cell types. As shown in Fig. 5, among these
cell types, BMSCs could be best induced for the expression of TNMD as
well as other tenogenic markers (p b 0.05), indicating that BMSCs may
have better potential for induced differentiation towards a particular
lineage in a transgenic model. ASCs, as another type of MSCs, exhibited
better induced expression of tenogenic markers than TCs for TNMD, TNC
and COL6 (p b 0.05). However, DFs exhibited the expression levels of
certain induced markers equivalent to those of ASCs, such as SCX, TNC,
DCN, COL1, COL3 and COL6 (p N 0.05).
3.6. Conditional TNMD overexpression promoted ASCs colony forming
efﬁciency

onies per dish, which was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the non-in-
duced cells (17 ± 3.9 colonies per dish, p b 0.05).
3.7. Conditional TNMD overexpression inhibited ASCs differentiation poten-
tials towards other lineages
Passage 3 ASCs derived from the transgenic mice were cultured with
or without 5 μM Dox and were subjected to osteogenic, chondrogenic
and adipogenic differentiation as described in the method. As shown,
conditional overexpression of TNMD signiﬁcantly inhibited the gene ex-
pression of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and Osteocalcin (p b 0.05), but
not Runx2 (p N 0.05) under osteogenic induction condition (Fig. 7A).
Relatively weaker Alizarin Red staining was found in Dox-induced
group than in non-induced group with signiﬁcant difference in the
staining area between two groups (Fig. 6D and E, p b 0.05).
Similarly, conditional TNMD overexpression led to signiﬁcantly re-
duced gene expression levels of SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9
(Sox9), collagen II (COL2) and Aggrecan when compared to the levels
of non-induced cells (p b 0.05, Fig. 7B). Additionally, relatively weaker
Alcian Blue staining was found in induced group than in non-induced
group with signiﬁcant difference in the staining area between two
groups (p b 0.05, Fig. 6D and F).
However, conditional overexpression of TNMD seemed to have no
effect on adipogenic differentiation of ASCs. As shown in Fig. 7C, no sig-
niﬁcant difference in the gene expression levels of adipocyte protein
2(aP2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), and
Adiponectin between two groups (p N 0.05). Additionally, there was
also no signiﬁcant difference in the Oil Red staining intensity and stain-
ing area between two groups (Fig. 6D and G, p N 0.05).
4. Discussion
Cell functions according to the signals triggered by a certain mole-
cule. Many examples have demonstrated such an important biological
process which determines the eventual function of a given cell type.
For example, transfection of BMP into cells could not only drive osteo-
genic differentiation of MSCs (Meinel et al., 2006), but also induce
transdifferentiation of DFs into osteoblasts (Ishihara et al., 2015). By

similar effect on tenogenic lineage differentiation of other cell types.
With the advances in genetic manipulation technologies, the best way
to study gene function might be through the generation of “gain-of-
function” (transgenic) or “loss-of-function” (knock-out, knock-down)
animal models. Previous report already revealed the importance of
TNMD in tendon development via loss-of-function model (Docheva et
al., 2005; Alberton et al., 2015), this study further investigated its func-
tion for cell lineage switch using gain-of-function way via TNMD over-
expression transgenic mouse model.
Tet-On transgenic mouse is an animal model that can efﬁciently in-
vestigate the function of a certain molecule, because the expression of
desired gene can be regulated in a temporal and dose-dependent way
(Kistner et al., 1996). As shown in Fig. 1, in the current study, a Dox-de-
pendent regulator, rtTA was employed to activate TNMD gene expres-
sion by its binding to pTRE-TNMD in the presence of Dox induction.
During the process, it was found that this transgenic mouse line has
been bred to homozygosity, and only 2 out of 8 founders were able to
be propagated to the ninth generation without silencing of transgene
expression (Table 2). Through further breeding with STOCK Tg
(rtTAhCMV) 4Uh/J mice, we were able to generate Tet-On conditional
TNMD transgenic mice, and the TNMD expression could be induced by
Dox temporally and in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
Although this animal model is potentially valuable for investigating
TNMD overexpression in tissue development, the current study mainly
focused on the effect of its overexpression on tenogenic lineage differ-
entiation of adult cells in an in vitro model.
In this study, BMSCs, ASCs and DFs were chosen because the former
two represent MSCs, whereas DFs represent mature and differentiated
somatic cell type. In addition, we also used TCs as a positive control.
As shown in Fig. 4, it was observed that Dox induction could signiﬁcant-
ly enhance TNMD expression in all four cell types along with signiﬁcant-
ly up-regulated gene expression of all tenogenic markers in general,
indicating that overexpressed TNMD not only enhanced tenogenic line-
age differentiation of MSCs, but was also able to promote
transdifferentiation of DFs.
To further compare the potentials among different cell types to-
wards tenogenic lineage, we artiﬁcially grouped the relative gene ex-
pression levels of a certain molecule from four cell types to make a
horizontal comparison. As shown in Fig. 5, although similar level of
TNMD was observed between BMSCs and ASCs (Fig. 5A), a signiﬁcantly
higher level of induced SCX expression, a transcription factor driving
MSC towards tenogenic lineage, was observed in BMSCs than in ASCs
(Fig. 5B), indicating greater tenogenic potential in BMSCs than in ASCs.
Interestingly, all tenogenic genes were induced in TCs with relatively
less extent. Although the mechanism remains unknown, we assumed
this was because that TCs themselves already exhibited a potent
tenogenic phenotype with relatively higher endogenous expression
levels and thus exogenous gene expression would not be able to further
greatly induce the expression of tenogenic markers.
Although DFs represent fully differentiated somatic cells, the relative
gene expression comparison indicates that DFs can achieve tenogenic
differentiation potential similar to that of ASCs. As shown in Fig. 5,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in the gene expression levels of
SCX, TNC, DCN, COL1, COL3 and COL6 between ASCs and DFs, suggesting
that DFs may become a possible cell source for tendon regeneration. In-
deed, it has been shown that DFs could be induced into a tenogenic phe-
notype via artiﬁcial cell elongation (Wang et al., 2016). In our previous
report, we also showed that DFs could replace TCs to engineer and re-
pair tendon defect in vivo (Liu et al., 2006).
A previous study from our group showed that TNMD overexpression
could reduce BMSCs differentiation towards osteogenic, chondrogenic
and adipogenic lineage (Jiang et al., 2016). Similar to BMSCs, TNMD
overexpression also led to signiﬁcantly reduced differential potentials
towards osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages of induced ASCs, as the
gene expression levels of AKP, osteocalcin (osteogenic markers), Sox 9,
collagen 2 and Aggrecan (chondrogenic markers) were signiﬁcantly

genes of ASCs under the induction of multi-lineage differentiation. qPCR analysis reveals
differential gene expression between non-induced and Dox-induced cell groups for
osteogenic (A) and chondrogenic (B) markers, but not for adipogenic markers(C).

overexpressing exogenous MyoD, a ﬁbroblast cell line could be induced
towards a skeletal muscle linage (Qin et al., 2007).
Tendon is an important part of musculoskeletal system, which is an
essential tissue type that transfers muscle contraction force to limb
movement. Additionally, TNMD is considered as an important molecule
for tendon development, because it not only serves as a tenogenic line-
age marker, but also regulates tendon matrix maturation and guides
tendon stem/progenitor cell destiny (Shukunami et al., 2001; Docheva
et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2016). As a type II transmembrane glycoprotein,
it is composed of extracellular domain which contains a highly con-
served C-terminal with eight cysteine residues region, a transmem-
brane domain from amino acid (aa) 31 to aa 49 (Brandau et al., 2001;
Dex et al., 2016). Thus far, its functions remain to be explored in addi-
tion to being as a speciﬁc marker for mature TCs. It was found that TC
number signiﬁcantly reduced and collagen superstructure was
disrupted in the tendon of TNMD knock-out mice, indicating its poten-
tial role in tendon development (Docheva et al., 2005; Alberton et al.,
2015).
In our previous study, we speciﬁcally invested the role of TNMD
overexpression in MSC tenogenic differentiation. It was demonstrated
that the overexpression not only enhanced tenogenic differentiation
of MSC line, but also promoted neotendon formation in vivo (Jiang et
al., 2016). However, it remains unknown if such an approach will have

down-regulated after Dox induction (Fig. 7A and B). This was also sup-
ported by the reduced staining area of Alizarin Red (Fig. 6D and E) and
Alcian Blue (Fig. 6D and F).
However, in contrast to our expectation, TNMD overexpression had
no effect on adipogenic differentiation potential in ASCs. Actually, previ-
ous studies revealed that TNMD may also participate in fat metabolism
(Tolppanen et al., 2007; Tolppanen et al., 2010). TNMD expression in-
creases in human preadipocytes during differentiation, whereas silenc-
ing TNMD blocks adipogenesis (Senol-Cosar et al., 2016). All these
reports suggest that TNMD may act as a protective factor in visceral ad-
ipose tissue to alleviate insulin resistance in obesity (Senol-Cosar et al.,
2016). Therefore, we assume that no effect of TNMD overexpression on
adipogenic lineage differentiation is likely caused by two reasons. One is
the already highly expressed endogenous TNMD gene when compared
to other vascularized soft tissues (Brandau et al., 2001), which renders
ASCs relatively insensitive to the driving effect of exogenous TNMD
gene expression. The other may rely on the great adipogenic lineage po-
tential naturally preserved in ASCs, which is less inﬂuenced by exoge-
nous gene when compared to other types of MSCs such as BMSCs.
Overall, transgenic mouse model via inserting TNMD gene into a fer-
tilized egg is theoretically able to distribute the gene evenly to all tissue
types in a fully developed animal body. This method provides a means
of ideal comparison among different cell types of the same animals, be-
cause the variations in gene transfection efﬁciency, gene insert place
and activation/inactivation of the inserted gene can be avoided in gen-
eral. Interestingly, this horizontal comparison provides the valuable in-
formation that BMSCs are more potent than ASCs for tenogenic lineage
differentiation and DFs exhibit the tenogenic potential similar to or per-
haps even better than ASCs. These ﬁndings may provide valuable ratio-
nales for the selection of proper cell source for tendon regeneration. In
the future, revealing the detailed mechanism how the TNMD overex-
pression triggers the tenogenic differentiation pathway in BMSCs will
be essential for both basic and translational works.
