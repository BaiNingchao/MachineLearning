An investigation into the reaction pathway of the electrochemical reduction of Ta2O5 to tantalum in a
eutectic CaCl2 –NaCl molten salt has been performed in order to better understand the reaction mech-
anism of the electro-deoxidation process. Partially reduced samples were obtained by interrupting the
reduction process after different reaction times at 1123 K, and examined by XRD, SEM and EDX analysis.
The results reveal that the reduction process from Ta2O5 to Ta undergoes several intermediate phases,
such as Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, Ta2O5 ·2CaO, and Ta2O5 ·4CaO. The particle morphology in the cathode changed
with the various phase transformations. The CaO concentration in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt seems to affect
the particle size of nodular-shaped tantalum powder products.

1. Introduction
Tantalum is widely used because of its properties of strong
corrosion resistance, high melting point, good ductility and heat
conductivity, etc. However, the major use for tantalum, as tanta-
lum metal powder, is in the production of tantalum capacitors,
which have very high capacity relative to their small volumes.
The dielectric is formed from a very thin anodized layer of tanta-
lum pentoxide. Tantalum powder can be industrially produced by
sodiothermic reduction of K2 TaF7 in the KCl–NaCl–NaF molten salt.
In this process K2 TaF7 is made from tantalum oxide ores, and then
was reduced to Ta at high temperatures (>1000 K) using sodium.
However, it is considered as a complex, expensive, and environ-
mentally polluting process [1–3], but, in recent years, some new
processes have been developed as promising methods to replace
the ﬂuoride-based process someday [1,4–16]. Metallothermic and
electrochemical reduction are two important processes carried out
in molten salts, from which many new metallurgical routes were
derived, such as FFC [6,7], EMR [9], PRP [10,11] and SOM [15,16].
The FFC process is a method to obtain metals and alloys by direct
electro-deoxidation of their respective oxides or mixtures of oxides
in chloride-based molten salts, which should be a much easier, less

expensive and more environmentally friendly way [2,17–21]. Many
metals and alloys have been produced by using this process, such
as Nb [17,22–24], Ta [2,8,25], Ti [6,20,21,26], Al [27], Nb–Sn [18],
Ni–Ti [28], Fe–Ti [29], Ce–Ni [30] and La–Ni [31,32]. Additionally,
the possible mechanism for the electro-deoxidation process has
been discussed [20–21,23,33,34], and some models also has been
applied to understand the process [35,36].
The metallothermic or electrochemical reduction of Ta2O5 has
been achieved in CaCl2 -based molten salts without any ﬂuoride
[6,9,12,13]. In particular, as a medium for the reactions, the molten
CaCl2 can enhance the reduction because the product CaO, pro-
duced at the reaction interface, can dissolve into the CaCl2 melt
[4,5,13]. Furthermore, the CaO in the molten CaCl2 can play an
interesting role on the reduction of Ta2O5 , which can affect the
morphology of tantalum powder prepared for the calciothermic
reduction [4,13], and form calcium tantalates as the intermediates
for the FFC process [2,33,34]. Greater understanding of CaO reac-
tions during the reduction in the molten CaCl2 –NaCl will be useful
in comprehending the mechanism of the FFC process.
The objective of this work has been to gain a greater insight into
the reaction between Ta2O5 and the CaO in the molten CaCl2 –NaCl
which occurs in the course of the electrochemical reduction of
Ta2O5 to tantalum in the FFC process. It is intended to understand
the electrochemical reductions of Ta2O5 in the melt of CaCl2 –NaCl
in order to better control and optimize experimental parameters,
which may be critical for successful industrialization.

2. Experimental
The Ta2 O5 powder was of 99.99% purity and purchased from Sino-pharm Chem-
ical Reagent Co. Ltd. Other chemicals in this study were of analytical grade. 1.5 g
of Ta2 O5 powder was weighed and compacted into cylindrical pellets (15 mm in
diameter and 2.3 mm in thickness) under 17 MPa, and then the oxide pellets were
sintered at 1273 K in air for 4 h. A eutectic mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl was ﬁrst ther-
mally pre-dried, then melted in an alumina crucible and served as the electrolyte.
The electrochemical experiments were conducted at 1123 K under an atmosphere
of dried argon. The electrolysis temperature is about 346 K higher than the eutectic
temperature of the CaCl2 –NaCl binary system, therefore the eutectic melt has a high
mobility and conductivity, which are favorable for the electrolysis.
For some experiments, about 1 mol% of CaO was added into the melt. The sin-
tered Ta2 O5 pellets served as the cathode, and a graphite rod as the anode, both were
attached to Kanthal wires which acted as the current collectors. The experimental
apparatus used here was similar to that described in the literature [8,23,25].
A voltage of 2.8 V was applied between the cathode and anode for the pre-
determined times. The partially and totally reduced samples were obtained by
stopping the electrochemical reduction at any time from 0.5 h to 24 h. In order to
get the chemical behavior of sintered Ta2 O5 pellets in the electrolyte melt with and
without the addition of CaO, the pellets were immersed in the melts for the times
from 6 h to 10 h with no cathodic polarization. After the simple immersion and
electrochemical reduction, respectively, the recovered samples were washed in de-
ionized water and dried in ambient air at room temperature. Each of the reduced or
immersed pellets was separated into several pieces for examination. Phase analysis
of the samples was carried out with a D/Max-2500PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu-
K␣ radiation, and the morphology was investigated by means of a SSX-550 scanning
electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The chemical reactions of Ta2O5 with CaO in the CaCl2 –NaCl
melt
Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of a porous Ta2O5 pellet sintered
at 1273 K for 4 h. The pellet typically contains particles of about
0.5 ␮m in diameter with an open porosity of 30–35%. The chemical
behavior of Ta2O5 in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with an addition of about
1 mol% CaO was investigated by submersing the oxide pellets into
the melts for 6 h and 7 h, respectively, and their XRD patterns are
both shown in Fig. 2a–c together with the XRD pattern of the sin-
tered Ta2O5 sample. The sample quenched after being immersed for
6 h is characterized by the overwhelming presence of Ta2O5 ·CaO.
As the immersing time increases, Ta2O5 ·2CaO occurs as well as
Ta2O5 ·CaO in the sample immersed for 7 h. Meanwhile, the sam-
ples in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with no addition of CaO for 6, 7 and
10 h were also composed of calcium tantalates as well, which typi-
cal XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2d–f. In general, there is a small
amount of CaO as an impurity in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt since cal-
cium chloride can absorb some moisture in ambient air and form
CaO from its derivatives like calcium hydroxide after being ther-
mally pre-dried and heated up to 1123 K. But, the concentration of
CaO should be lower than that in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with about
1 mol% CaO added. That is the probable reason for formation of
CaO–Ta2O5 compounds in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with no addition of
CaO. The reaction shown in Eq. (1) could occur spontaneously and
(1)
successively in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with some CaO at 1123 K.
nCaO + Ta2O5 → Ta2O5 · nCaO (n = 0.5, 1, 2, 4)
Moreover, there are stable calcium tantalates observed in
Ta2O5 –CaO binary phase diagram [37]. The predominant calcium
tantalate formed in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt is Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO in the
sample which was immersed for 6 and 7 h, and a little of Ta2O5 ·CaO
was found in the sample for 10 h. Although the duration of its
immersion in the melt is longer than that of the samples in the
CaCl2 –NaCl melt with about 1 mol% CaO, the number of CaO incor-
porated into one Ta2O5 unit on average is smaller. Therefore, it can
be deduced that the number of CaO included per Ta2O5 unit for the
calcium tantalate seems strongly dependent on the concentration
of CaO in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt.
Fig. 1b shows the morphology of the Ta2O5 pellet which was
immersed in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with about 1 mol% CaO for 7 h,
and then quenched and washed in water. There are larger, lath-
shaped particles in the interior region of the pellet, in which the
molar ratio of Ta to Ca is about 2:1 according to the EDX anal-
compound of Ta2O5 ·CaO by considering of its XRD analysis shown
ysis together with its SEM image. These are expected to be the
in Fig. 2c. There are also relatively smaller, cubic particles in the
outer region of the same pellet, where the ratio is close to 1:1 by
EDX analysis. These are the compound of Ta2O5 ·2CaO, which was
deduced by considering of their XRD and EDX analysis. There is a
clear boundary between the inner and outer region, marked by a
diffuse reaction front moving into the pellet from its surface. Prob-
ably, Ta2O5 ·2CaO can be formed in the outer region where CaO in
the melt has diffused through the channels of open porosity in the
sample. Elsewhere, the CaO percolation has been less effective, and

tal frequently obtain the electrons from the cathode lead and move
into the CaCl2 –NaCl melt, leaving behind empty lattice sites. The
value of x in Eq. (2) is determined by the concentration of the oxygen
vacancies, which should not exceed the maximum that the stable
Ta2O5 ·nCaO crystalline lattice can accept. The intrinsic defects Ta(cid:4)
would be produced in the Ta2O5 ·nCaO crystal particles along with
charge compensating defects V
O , which means Ta2O5 is partially
reduced during the ﬁrst 0.5 h of the reduction process although
Ta2O5 and Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO can only be identiﬁed for the typical XRD
pattern.
Fig. 4a is the SEM image of the partially reduced sample for 0.5 h.
There were two types of particles classiﬁed by their particle sizes.
According to their respective EDX analysis shown in Table 1, the
molar ratio of Ta to Ca is 32:8 for the region A, which indicated
Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, conﬁrmed by its XRD analysis; while the molar ratio
is about 62:1 for the region B, the major phase is Ta2O5 as indicated
by the small amount of Ca and its XRD pattern.
The sample recovered after about 1 h is mainly composed of
Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO and Ta2O5 ·2CaO, and XRD pattern is also shown in
Fig. 3b. There is the additional presence of Ta, which is detected
from its typical XRD pattern. But no Ta2O5 exists as shown by the
XRD pattern. It seems that almost all Ta2O5 , combined with CaO and
form calcium tantalates. Fig. 4b shows the morphology of partially
reduced sample for 1 h. The EDX analysis was carried out for the
regions which are marked as C and D, respectively. The molar ratio
of Ta to Ca is 43: 9 for region C, where the major phase should be
Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, while the molar ratio for region D is 22:16, where
two phases should be Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO and Ta2O5 ·2CaO. The mor-
phology of the particles in region D reﬂects the aggregates of the
smaller ﬂakes, which was created by the network modifying effects
of CaO in the melt on the surface of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO. When more of
the network-modifying CaO is combined with Ta2O5 , this disinte-
grates the larger particles of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO. It should be mentioned
that Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO may still exists inside the particles, which leads
than 1:1 of Ta2O5 ·2CaO for region D.
the molar ratio of Ta to Ca obtained by EDX analysis to be bigger
Fig. 3c also shows XRD pattern of the sample reduced for about
2 h, which comprises basically Ta, Ta2O5 ·2CaO and Ta2O5 ·4CaO, the
latter was not found within the sample immersed simply in the melt
both with and without the addition of CaO in this study. During fur-
ther electrochemical reduction, there are two possible streams to
enrich the local concentration of CaO within the cathode. First, CaO
can be released directly from calcium tantalates through the reac-
tion (3). Second, the oxygen ions released by the reaction (2) can
incorporate with Ca2+ in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt and form more CaO.
The enhancement of the local CaO concentration in the melt which
percolates the cathode can lead to an increase in the CaO/Ta2O5
ratio. The typical peaks of Ta are more dominant compared with
those of the samples reduced for 1 h from their XRD patterns, and
there is almost no Ta2O5 ·CaO identiﬁed since it can incorporate CaO
to form Ta2O5 ·2CaO or Ta2O5 ·4CaO. Finally, tantalum is obtained by
the reaction (3).
Ta2O5−x · (VO )x · nCaO + 2(5 − x)e = 2Ta + (5 − x)O2− + nCaO (3)
For the whole electrochemical process, no tantalum sub-oxides
and their compounds with CaO were observed from the typical
XRD patterns. It is probable that Ta2O5 ·nCaO can be reduced to Ta
directly without any intermediates in which the oxidation state of

10 h, (g) 13 h and (h) 24 h, respectively.
Ta2O5 ·CaO has been formed in the inner region since the amount of
CaO is in short supply, and the local concentration of CaO was lower
in the inner region of the pellet. Similar effects probably occurred
for the samples in the melt without the addition of CaO for 10 h
though the quenched sample was broken up after being washed
in water and its integrity was not maintained. Fig. 1c shows its
SEM image. The particles should be the compound of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO,
which was identiﬁed by its XRD pattern in Fig. 2f. The calcium tanta-
lates in this study exhibit a strongly faceted morphology as shown
in Fig. 1b and c. The particle size of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO can reach up to
20 ␮m shown in Fig. 1c, which is about 40 times bigger than that
of the original grains in the Ta2O5 pellet. The atomic structures
formed from corner-, edge- and face-sharing TaO6 octahedra while
Ca2+ ions were located in interstitial sites among the octahedra.
The greater amount of CaO that was incorporated per Ta2O5 unit,
the greater the number of O atoms that go to the TaO6 octahedron
arrays. Therefore, the number of bridging oxygen (BO) decreases
and the number of non-bridging oxygen (NBO) increases in the
TaO6 octahedron arrays so that the more complex and bigger net-
works of TaO octahedra were broken up into simpler and smaller
ones. CaO behaves here as a network modiﬁer.
3.2. The electrochemical reduction of Ta2O5 in the CaCl2 –NaCl
melt with about 1 mol% CaO
The partially reduced tantalum oxide specimens were obtained
by interrupting the electrochemical reduction after different reac-
tion times. Fig. 3a–c show the XRD patterns of partially reduced
samples in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with about 1 mol% CaO for 0.5 h,
1 h and 2 h, respectively. The sample quenched after electrolysis
for 0.5 h consists predominantly of Ta2O5 and Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, the
latter is one member of calcium tantalates which are formed by the
chemical reactions shown in Eq. (1) as explained previously. Even
though electrons were supplied to the tantalum oxide cathode, no
tantalum sub-oxides can be identiﬁed from the XRD pattern. One of
the most likely effects during reduction is the formation of oxygen
vacancies in the atomic structures of Ta2O5 or Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO. The
reaction can be expressed as Eq. (2).
Ta2O5 · nCaO + x · 2e = Ta2O5−x · (VO )x · nCaO + xO2−
(n = 0, 0.5, 2, 4)

The oxygen vacancies, as point defects, exist in Ta2O5 or

tantalum atom may be lower than 5. This differs from the reduc-
tion pathway of TiO2 [20,21,33,34] or Nb2O5 [22,23] by the FFC
process. It is also different from the results of Chen and co-workers
[2]. Usually, metals in lower oxidation states can be found during
the reduction of TiO2 in the molten CaCl2 [20,21,33].
Fig. 4c shows the morphology of partially reduced sample for 2 h.
The size of most particles in the sample is smaller than 2 ␮m. The
aggregate of particles has an alveolate structure shown in Fig. 4c,
which are probably the result of disagglomeration of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO
to Ta2O5 ·4CaO by combination of more CaO. Therefore, Ta2O5 ·4CaO
particles are smaller in size than Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO.
Fig. 3d–f shows the typical XRD patterns of the partially reduced
samples for 4.5 h, 5.5 h and 10 h, respectively. The major phase is
Ta, and the minor phases are Ta2O5 ·4CaO, Ta2O5 ·2CaO and CaCO3
after 4.5 h electrolysis. The formation of CaCO3 may be because
of the use of graphite anode in this study. Carbon dioxide can
be generated on the anode during electrolysis, and dissolved in
the CaCl2 –NaCl melt as CO2−
3 . Fig. 4d is the SEM image of par-
tially reduced sample for 5.5 h electrolysis, in which the alveolate
structures can be found. Considering its typical XRD pattern, it con-
sists mainly of Ta, and Ta2O5 ·4CaO with a smaller particle size.
The particles bigger than 5 ␮m cannot be observed, these are very
normal in the sample of 1 h reduction as Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO. Fig. 4e
shows the morphology of the partially reduced sample for 10 h
electrolysis. The number of smaller size particles becomes more
and more, and some of them are interconnected one another. But
the particle size is not uniform probably because the sample is not
reduced completely and the calcium tantalates particle size may be
bigger.
Fig. 3g–h shows the two typical XRD patterns of the samples
reduced for 13 h and 24 h, respectively. Metallic tantalum is the
only phase being present in both samples. After undergoing sev-
eral intermediate phases, such as Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, Ta2O5 ·2CaO and
Ta2O5 ·4CaO, the starting material Ta2O5 was completely reduced to
tantalum. During the process of immersion and reduction, only cal-
cium tantalates determined from the XRD patterns and no sodium
tantalates are found. Similarly, calcium niobates were formed dur-
ing the electrochemical reduction of Nb2O5 in the CaCl2 –NaCl
molten salt, while sodium niobates were not observed according
the XRD patterns [38,39]. The phenomenon was probably because
the calcium tantalates formed were thermodynamically more sta-
ble than sodium tantalates in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt. Fig. 4f is the SEM
image of the sample reduced for 24 h. It shows the uniform parti-
cle sizes and similar nodular shapes of the metal tantalum product.
One interesting aspect of the Ta particles is that the smaller nodu-
lar Ta particles are interconnected to one another, which was also
described in the literature [2]. Such structures are considered to be
preferable for their application of electronic capacitors.
Fig. 5 is the current vs. time curve of electrochemical reduc-
tion experiment in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with about 1 mol% CaO, in
which cathode composition was given for various points in time
during electrolysis. Based on the explanation of the mechanism
put forward above, the current peaks are caused by fast reductions
of the cathode with participation of calcium oxide, which lead to

the formation of calcium tantalate mixtures. Ta2O5 ·4CaO has the
most number of CaO per Ta2O5 unit among the tantalates, which
should have the lowest degree of polymerization for TaO6 octahe-
dron. It exists until Ta2O5 is completely reduced to Ta. During the
later stages of the reduction process, while calcium tantalates for-
mation seems to cease, the removal of oxygen from the cathode
becomes the dominant process. However, the electronic current
now contributes signiﬁcantly to the overall current, and leads the
relatively low overall current efﬁciency of about 11% for prepara-
tion of tantalum with low oxygen contents by the process.
3.3. The electrochemical reduction of Ta2O5 in the CaCl2 –NaCl
melt
As mentioned above, there should be some CaO as an impurity
in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt with no addition of CaO. But the concentra-
tion of CaO in the melt is lower than that of the CaCl2 –NaCl melt
with about 1 mol% CaO added specially. Fig. 6a–c shows the XRD
patterns of partially reduced samples in the melt for 0.5 h, 1 h, and
2 h, respectively. Ta had already been detected by XRD analysis for
partially reduced sample for 0.5 h, while the characteristic peaks
of Ta2O5 were not found. The major phase is Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, similar
to the sample in the melt with about 1 mol% CaO. During the elec-
trochemical reduction, Ta2O5 ·2CaO and Ta2O5 ·4CaO can be formed
successively, which are detected from the XRD patterns of sample
reduced for 1 h and 2 h, respectively. At the same time, the amount
of Ta is increasing apparently according to their XRD patterns. The
morphology of the sample reduced for 0.5 h is shown in Fig. 7a.
Some of the particles are bigger than 5 ␮m. The EDX analysis were
carried on for the regions where the larger particle of E and the
Fig. 6. XRD patterns of the samples electro-deoxidized in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt for

smaller one of F are found with the molar ratios of Ta to Ca are
37:9 and 55:0, respectively. Therefore, the larger particle is prob-
ably Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO, while the smaller one is Ta by considering of
their XRD results as well. Fig. 7b is the SEM image of the sample
reduced for 2 h. The amount of small nodular particles is increas-
ing, which are probably metallic Ta. The bigger particles may be
Ta2O5 ·2CaO or Ta2O5 ·4CaO, whose particle size is smaller than that
of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO particles shown in Fig. 7a. The surface of the bigger
particles has a terraced structure, and there are traces of disag-
glomeration of Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO to Ta2O5 ·4CaO by combination of CaO.
Fig. 6d–e shows the typical XRD patterns for the samples reduced
6.5 h are Ta and Ta2O5 ·4CaO. There are also some typical peaks for
for 6.5 h and 12 h, respectively. The major phases in the sample for
CaCO3 , and its formation can be explained as mentioned previously.
After 12 h electrolysis, the starting material, Ta2O5 is completely
reduced to Ta according to its XRD pattern. Its morphology is shown
in Fig. 7c. The tantalum product consists of the interconnected
nodular shape particles. It is intriguing that the particle size of
most nodules is bigger than that of the particles reduced in the melt
with the CaO concentration of 1 mol% higher. The reason is probably
related with the role which CaO plays during electro-deoxidation.
Suzuki and co-workers [4,13] had also found that CaO concentra-
tion affects the morphology of the tantalum powder, which is the
product of calciothermic reduction of Ta2O5 in the molten CaCl2 .
Fig. 8 is the current vs. time curve of electrochemical reduction
experiment in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt, in which cathode composi-
tion was given for various points in time during electrolysis. Its
shape is somewhat different to that for the CaCl2 –NaCl with 1 mol%
CaO, and the time-averaged current intensity for the ﬁrst 5 h is
lower, although the intermediate products of the electrochemi-

ode undergoes several intermediate phases, such as Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO,
Ta2O5 ·2CaO, Ta2O5 ·4CaO, and ﬁnally changes to metal Ta. The
incorporation of more CaO can disintegrate the higher calcium tan-
talates with a larger particle size to the lower ones with smaller
particle size. The bulk concentration of CaO in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt
seems to affect the particle size of the ﬁnal product, Ta. The sintered
porous Ta2O5 pellets can chemically react with CaO in the melt and
form Ta2O5 ·nCaO, successively, in which n is strongly dependent
on the concentration of CaO in the melt.

cal reductions are the same. This means CaO in the melt probably
has some activation for the electrochemical reduction on the Ta2O5
cathode.
From the experimental results of this study, the driving-force
of the incorporation of CaO into Ta2O5 should be the minimum
of total chemical potential energy since calcium tantalates can be
formed from Ta2O5 and CaO in the melt without any cathodic polar-
ization. There is no evidence to conﬁrm calcium tantalates as the
products of the calcium cathodic intercalation, which was used
to explain the formation of calcium titanates [20,21,33]. CaO in
the CaCl2 –NaCl melt is incorporated with Ta2O5 to higher tanta-
lates, such as Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO and Ta2O5 ·CaO, both having a much
larger particle size, and Ta2O5 ·0.5CaO is the overwhelming phase
for the sample which is simply immersed in the CaCl2 –NaCl melt.
When the bulk concentration of CaO was increased by adding
about 1 mol% CaO to the CaCl2 –NaCl melt, the major phases were
Ta2O5 ·CaO and Ta2O5 ·2CaO, and the particle size of Ta2O5 ·2CaO is
smaller than that of Ta2O5 ·CaO particles as shown in Fig. 1b. This
implies incorporation of more CaO per Ta2O5 unit disintegrated the
large grains of higher calcium tantalates, and this view was con-
ﬁrmed by the fact of the much smaller particle size of Ta2O5 ·4CaO.
It means that CaO in the melt is a network modiﬁer for the higher
calcium tantalates with a larger particle size, which can be disin-
tegrated to smaller ones, just like “hydration process” for ions in
aqueous solutions. So, the higher the bulk concentration of CaO in
the melt, the more opportunities for the higher tantalates to be
separated to the lower ones with smaller particle size, which may
strongly affect the particle size of the ﬁnally reduced product, metal
tantalum.
4. Conclusions
The reaction pathway of electrochemical reduction of Ta2O5 to
tantalum was studied under a voltage of 2.8 V in the CaCl2 –NaCl
melt with and without the addition of CaO by interrupting the
reduction after various reaction times at 1123 K. During the
reduction process from Ta2O5 to Ta, the tantalum oxide cath-
