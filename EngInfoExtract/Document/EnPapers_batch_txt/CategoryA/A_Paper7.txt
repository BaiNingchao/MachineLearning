Abstract
Production of titanium powder directly from titanium dioxide (TiO2) through an electronically mediated reaction (EMR) using calcium as
a reductant was investigated. Feed material (TiO2 powder or preform) and reductant (Ca–Ni alloy) were charged in electronically isolated
locations in a molten calcium chloride (CaCl2) salt at 1173 K, and the current ﬂow through an external circuit between the feed and reductant
locations was monitored during reduction of TiO2. The voltage between feed electrode and reductant alloy was intermittently measured
during the reduction experiment to monitor the reduction process. After the reduction experiment, pure titanium powder with low nickel
content was obtained even though liquid Ca–Ni alloy was used as a reductant. These results demonstrate that titanium metal powder can be
produced without direct physical contact between the feed and reductant. In some experimental conditions, pure titanium powder with 99.5
mass% purity was successfully obtained.

1. Introduction
At present, titanium is industrially manufactured by the
Kroll process [1], which is based on the magnesiothermic
reduction of titanium chloride. Although the Kroll process is
suitable for producing high-purity titanium, it is a labor-
intensive, batch-type process with low productivity. Even
when large-scale modern facilities are used [2], It takes over
10 days to produce 10 tons of sponge titanium. With this
background, a new efﬁcient reduction process that can serve
as an alternative to the Kroll process is being investigated by

many researchers. Although various types of titanium
reduction processes were studied in the past, none of them
could be used for industrial purposes. The key factors in
developing a commercial process, which can compete with
the Kroll process, are the establishment of technology for
effective purity control and/or speeding up the reduction
process.
Fray et al. have recently been trying to develop a new
industrial reduction process, called the FFC Cambridge
process, based on the direct electrochemical reduction of
TiO2 to metallic titanium in molten CaCl2 salt [3]. Their
extensive work has not only inspired academic research
activity on titanium but has also stimulated the related
industries. As a result, a large variety of
titanium
reduction processes are currently under
investigation
[4–6]. For example, Ono and Suzuki are engaged in
developing a commercial process, based on the cal-
ciothermic reduction of TiO2 powder in molten CaCl2
salt during electrolysis [4].

In this study, we carried out fundamental research on a
new titanium reduction process with the purpose of
developing new technology for preventing the accumulation
of impurities in titanium deposits using an electronically
mediated reaction (EMR) [7,8]. The EMR is not only
effective in maintaining purity control but is also suitable for
improving energy efﬁciency when it is combined with the
conventional molten salt electrolysis (MSE) of CaO in
molten CaCl2 salt, for producing reductant calcium alloy.
One of the features of the EMR/MSE process is that the
reduction of TiO2 takes place without any direct contact
with the reductant alloy because titanium is reduced by
electrons released from the reductant. By using the EMR/
MSE process, the reduction of TiO2 and the electric power
input for producing reductant alloy can be carried out
separately. This makes it possible to carry out titanium
reduction during the day and electrolysis for producing
reductant alloy during the night. The possibility of applying
this EMR/MSE process for the reduction of TiO2 was
investigated in this study.
2. Experiment
Experimental conditions of reductions are shown in
Table 1, and a schematic diagram of the reduction apparatus
is shown in Fig. 1. Anhydrous CaCl2 was used as the molten
salt medium, which was dried in a vacuum at 473 K for over
12 h before the experiment. TiO2 powder or a preform
containing TiO2 powder (5w8 g) was kept in a sample
holder and charged in molten CaCl2 salt (1300w1500 g) at
1173 K in an argon atmosphere. The holder containing the
TiO2 powder was placed in the molten salt to prevent it from
making physical contact with the Ca–18 mass% Ni
reductant alloy (50w90 g). TiO2 was thus electrochemi-
cally reduced using electrons discharged from the reductant
alloy. The current ﬂow (iA/C) through an external circuit
between TiO2 and the Ca–Ni alloy was monitored using a
standard resistance of 1 mU. In order to monitor the driving
force of the chemical reaction, the voltage (DEA/C) between
the feed electrode and reductant alloy was intermittently
measured by opening the external circuit during the
reduction experiment.
After the reduction experiment, the sample holder was
taken out of the reactor, and was soaked in distilled water

for 24 h to dissolve the CaCl2. The titanium powder
obtained after the experiment was recovered by leaching it
with acetic acid and hydrochloric acid. The metal powder
obtained was then rinsed with distilled water, alcohol, and
acetone, and ﬁnally dried in a vacuum. The morphology of
the metal powder was observed by a scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Phases in the sample were identiﬁed by
an X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The composition of the
sample was determined using an energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS), and an inductively coupled plasma-
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The oxygen
concentration of the powder deposit was determined by an
inert gas fusion-infrared absorption spectroscopy.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 2(a), an external current (iA/C) of
0.2w0.4 A was observed between the anode and cathode for
the ﬁrst 500 s. Time zero corresponds to the moment when
the feed TiO2 powder in the sample holder (cathode) was
charged into the molten CaCl2 salt. The reductant Ca–Ni
alloy (anode) was also charged into the molten salt at the
same time. The external current, iA/C, decreased to below
0.1 A after 3 ks. When the external current fell below
0.03 A, the sample holder was taken out of the molten CaCl2
salt. In most cases, the reduction was completed within
7.2 ks (2 h). The value of the electric charge (Qexp) that
passed through the external path was calculated by means of
time integration of the observed external current, and it was

about 650 C for the case shown in Fig. 2(a). It was found
that this value was about 3% of the theoretical electric
charge (Qtheo) necessary for reducing 5 g of TiO2 as feed
material. The percentage of the obtained charge in relation
to the theoretical charge, EMR ratio (XEMR (Z100!Qexp/
Qtheo)), varied between 1w9% depending upon experimen-
tal conditions. Fig. 2(b) shows the change in the voltage
between the anode and cathode obtained by opening an
external circuit intermittently. Until 2 ks after beginning the
reduction experiment, the voltage was above 0.05 V, and
DEA/C decreased with time. The theoretical electromotive
force of the reaction, DEtheo, calculated from the standard
ZK240:6 kJ [9]) in the reaction,
Gibbs energy change (DG8
TiO2(s)C2 Ca (l)/Ti (s)C2 CaO (s), was 0.62 V at
1173 K. The value of DEA/C observed during the reduction
experiment was substantially smaller than that of DEtheo.
The reasons for the values of EMR ratio and DEA/C are
smaller than the theoretical values were not clear at this
stage, but it is possible that the dissolution of calcium in the
molten CaCl2 salt caused an electric conduction through the
CaCl2. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the SEM image and XRD
pattern of the obtained titanium powder, respectively. It was
found that pure titanium powder was produced in the sample
holder after the reduction experiment. The analytical results
of the obtained titanium powder and EMR ratio are listed in
Table 2. Titanium with high purity of 99.5% or more was
obtained using an EMR. In a certain experimental condition,
titanium powder with 3500 mass ppm of oxygen was
successfully obtained. This result clearly shows that the feed
material (TiO2) was reduced without any physical contact
with the reductant (Ca–Ni alloy). It is worth noting that
the nickel content in the titanium was quite low at just 0.2
mass%, even though a Ca–Ni alloy was used as the

reductant. The detailed mechanism of TiO2 reduction in
mo lten CaC l2 us ing an EMR is curren tly under
investigation.
To understand the local reaction, a three-dimensional
(3D) chemical potential diagram of the Ti–Ca–O system at
1173 K was constructed, and is shown in Fig. 4(a) [9,10]. As
the Ca–Ni alloy was used in the reduction experiment, the
activity of Ca was not unity in theory, therefore, the stability
plane of Ca (l) in Fig. 4(a) shifts to lower activity region.
But this shift can be neglected considering the scale of the
diagram. The diagram provides an insight into the phase
relationship during the EMR. Point ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Fig. 4(a),
corresponding to Ti/Ca/CaO and Ti/TiO/CaO equilibrium
can be connected through the metal/molten salt interface

the reduction process. The reduction of TiO2 proceeds
without direct physical contact with the reductant Ca–Ni
alloy, and contamination of titanium can effectively be
prevented by utilizing the EMR. This approach may be
applied to develop a (semi-)continuous production of
titanium powder.

interface, which corre-

connects the two three-phase ﬁelds. In this situation, the
reductant calcium need not necessarily make physical
contact with the titanium oxides; rather electron and ion
transfer can be considered to be the major step especially in
the process with molten CaCl2.

TiO2 in molten CaCl2 salt showed that the electronically
